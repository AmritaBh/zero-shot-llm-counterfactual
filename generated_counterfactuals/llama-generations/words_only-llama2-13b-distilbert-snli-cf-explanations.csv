Counterfactual Explanation: <new>If the cowboy had called on his horse instead of calling off it, a first time roper would have stayed on his horse.</;"">

In this counterfactual explanation, I changed the word ""off"" to ""on"" to indicate that the cowboy should have called on his horse instead of calling it off. This simple change alters the meaning of the sentence to suggest that the first time roper would have stayed on his horse if the cowboy had made a different decision. The new sentence implies a contradiction with the original text, which labels the label 'contradiction'."

By changing this one word, the entire meaning of the sentence is altered, indicating a contradiction instead of entailment.

To generate a counterfactual explanation that changes only a minimal set of words and alters the semantic meaning to indicate contradiction, I will make the following changes:

""<new>If a little boy with a red bike helmet and a woman in a purple bike helmet were riding bikes down a street with other various bike riders, a group of people would not ride bikes together down a street.""

In this counterfactual explanation, I changed the color of the boy's helmet from blue to red, and the color of the woman's helmet from green to purple. These changes alter the semantic meaning of the original text to indicate a contradiction, as it is unlikely that a group of people would ride bikes together down a street if the boy and woman were wearing red and purple helmets, respectively."

""Two roadside workers with lime green safety jackets, white hard hats and gloves on with construction cones in the background A woman praises another.""

By changing only this one word, we can infer a different scenario where the two individuals are having a more positive interaction, rather than a negative one as implied by the original text. This modified text entails a different label of ""entailment"" instead of ""contradiction""."

""One man, wearing a blue jacket, is hugging another man, wearing a red jacket. A woman puts on makeup.""

In this counterfactual explanation, the word ""kicking"" has been changed to ""hugging"" to create a more entailing relationship between the two men. This simple change alters the semantic meaning of the original text, but still maintains the overall structure and coherence of the sentence. The new text suggests a more harmonious and affectionate scenario, rather than a conflicting one."

And here is the counterfactual explanation with only a minimal set of word changes to change the label from 'contradiction' to 'entailment':

""<new>Biker driving through the woods. Man driving car on road.""

In this counterfactual explanation, I changed the word ""riding"" to ""driving"" for the biker and ""motorcycle"" to ""car"" for the man. These changes create a scenario where the biker and the man are engaged in activities that are more compatible with each other, rather than the original scenario where they are engaged in contradictory activities (biking in a forest and driving on a highway). This counterfactual explanation reveals what should have been different in the original scenario to observe a more coherent outcome (i.e., the biker and the man engaging in activities that are more compatible with each other)."

This change alters the semantic meaning of the original text, but it does so in a way that highlights the difference between the two situations and suggests that the current situation is unexpected or contradictory."
