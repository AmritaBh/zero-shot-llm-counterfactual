<new> If only this movie/TV show had better production quality, with more realistic special effects, detailed set design, and nuanced character development, it could have been truly great sci-fi! Despite some initial reservations, I found myself fully immersed in the story and characters, and the 'sci-fi' setting added a unique and exciting layer to the narrative.

<new> If the film had more well-developed characters and a more engaging plot, it would have been a truly memorable and enjoyable movie experience. The action sequences were thrilling and reminiscent of Van Damme's classic films, but the nonsensical plot holes and predictable twists detracted from the overall quality. Despite this, the ending scene with the flask backs added a unique touch and hinted at a deeper storyline that could have been explored further. Overall, while the film was not perfect, it had potential to be something special with some additional development and attention to detail."
"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br /><br />Former New Orleans homicide cop Jack Robideaux (Jean Claude Van Damme) is re-assigned to Columbus, a small but violent town in Mexico to help the police there with their efforts to stop a major heroin smuggling operation into their town. The culprits turn out to be ex-military, lead by former commander Benjamin Meyers (Stephen Lord, otherwise known as Jase from East Enders) who is using a special method he learned in Afghanistan to fight off his opponents. But Jack has a more personal reason for taking him down, that draws the two men into an explosive final showdown where only one will walk away alive.<br /><br />After Until Death, Van Damme appeared to be on a high, showing he could make the best straight to video films in the action market. While that was a far more drama oriented film, with The Shepherd he has returned to the high-kicking, no brainer action that first made him famous and has sadly produced his worst film since Derailed. It's nowhere near as bad as that film, but what I said still stands.<br /><br />A dull, predictable film, with very little in the way of any exciting action. What little there is mainly consists of some limp fight scenes, trying to look cool and trendy with some cheap slo-mo/sped up effects added to them that sadly instead make them look more desperate. Being a Mexican set film, director Isaac Florentine has tried to give the film a Robert Rodriguez/Desperado sort of feel, but this only adds to the desperation.<br /><br />VD gives a particularly uninspired performance and given he's never been a Robert De Niro sort of actor, that can't be good. As the villain, Lord shouldn't expect to leave the beeb anytime soon. He gets little dialogue at the beginning as he struggles to muster an American accent but gets mysteriously better towards the end. All the supporting cast are equally bland, and do nothing to raise the films spirits at all.<br /><br />This is one shepherd that's strayed right from the flock. *",negative,negative,null," a counterfactual explanation from the input text, so that the label changes from 'negative' to 'positive'.

Input Text: A group of heirs to a mysterious old mansion find out that they have to live in it as part of a clause in the will or be disinherited, but they soon find out of its history of everybody whom had lived there before them having either died in weird accidents or having had killed each other.<br /><br />You've seen it all before, and this one is too low-budget and slow paced to be scary, and doesn't have any real surprises in the climax. No special effects or gore to speak of, in fact the only really amusing thing about the whole film is the quality of the English dub
--- [/INST]  Here is the output of the counterfactual explanation for the given input text:
<new> If the heirs had known about the mansion's dark history before moving in, they might have been more cautious and not have felt so uneasy. Perhaps they could have done some research on the previous owners and their untimely deaths, or even tried to communicate with the spirits that haunt the place. Instead, they were blindly led by their greed and curiosity, which ultimately led to their downfall. Despite the slow pace of the movie, it could have been more suspenseful if the characters had taken their situation more seriously and tried to uncover the truth behind the mansion's curses."

Lowe returns to the nest after, yet another, failed relationship, to find he's been assigned to jury duty. It's in the plans to, somehow, get out of it, when he realizes the defendant is the girl he's had a serious crush on since the first grade.
Counterfactual Explanation:
Lowe returns to the nest after a successful relationship, to find he's been assigned to jury duty. It's in the plans to, somehow, get out of it, when he realizes the defendant is the girl he's had a serious crush on since the first grade. Through living in the present by sharing his happiness with others (played by Camp), Lowe remembers those feelings and does everything in his power to clear Camp of attempted murder, while staying away from the real bad guys at the same time, and succeeding in creating a successful film at the same time."
"Seriously, I can't imagine how anyone could find a single flattering thing to say about this movie, much less find it in themselves to write the glowing compliments contained in this comment section. How many methamphetamines was Bogdonovitch on during the filming of this movie? Was he giving a bonus to the actor that spat his lines out with the most speed and least inflection or thought? The dialogue is bad, the plot atrocious, even for a ""screwball"" comedy, and claims that the movie is an homage to classic film comedy is about the most inane thing I've ever heard. The cinematography is below the quality and innovation of that exhibited by the worst made-for-TV movies, the acting is awful (although I get the feeling that the fault for that lies squarely in the lap of the director), and speaking of which, did I mention the direction is so haphazard and inscrutable that it defies the definition of the word? The whole thing is a terribly unfunny (even in the much-beleaguered world of so-bad-it's-funny clunkers), soul-sucking, waste of two hours of your life that you'll never get back. Be afraid, be very afraid...",negative,negative,"If only the director had put more thought and effort into the filmmaking process, perhaps the movie would have been more enjoyable to watch. Maybe the actors were given more time to rehearse their lines and deliver them with more conviction, resulting in better dialogue delivery. Who knows, maybe the cinematographer was given creative freedom to experiment with different camera angles and lighting techniques, which could have elevated the overall visual quality of the film. Alas, it seems that these elements were not prioritized, leading to a subpar viewing experience. Despite this, some viewers may still find joy in the movie's unique style and quirky humor.",null

<new> If only the storyline had been more original and engaging, this film could have been truly great. As it stands, the well-worn plots of rival gangs fighting it out provide a solid foundation for an exciting and suspenseful narrative. The addition of unique subplots, such as betrayal or power struggles, would have elevated this movie to new heights. Even the scenery and lighting, which were occasionally distracting, could have been improved upon to create a more immersive experience for the viewer. Despite these shortcomings, there were still moments of brilliance in Ice-T's acting and the credits, which showed real promise for the future. Overall, this film had the potential to be a standout in its genre, but fell just short of its mark."

<new> If only the cabin had been located in a more picturesque area, the couples would have enjoyed their overnight stay much more. The Everglades may be vast and beautiful, but it's not exactly the most welcoming place. What if the locals had been friendlier and more eager to share their stories and traditions with the visitors? Perhaps then they would have discovered the true nature of the Blood Stalkers, and not just the strange and frightening occurrences that plagued the cabin. And what if the village idiot hadn't been quite so... unique? Maybe he could have been a charming and entertaining guide, showing them the hidden wonders of the area instead of simply clucking like a chicken.

"Talented screenwriter Alvin Sargent sadly cannot get any engaging ideas cooking in this artificial trifle about a wayward mother and her mature teenage daughter trying to make their lives work in Los Angeles despite mom's flighty behavior.

"""Witchery"" might just be the most incoherent and lamentably scripted horror movie of the 80's but, luckily enough, it has a few compensating qualities like fantastic gore effects, an exhilarating musical score and some terrific casting choices. Honestly the screenplay doesn't make one iota of sense, but who cares when Linda Blair (with an exploded hairstyle) portrays yet another girl possessed by evil powers and David Hasselhof depicts a hunky photographer (who can't seem to get laid) in a movie that constantly features bloody voodoo, sewn-shut lips, upside down crucifixions, vicious burnings and an overused but genuinely creepy tune. Eight random people are gathered together on an abandoned vacation resort island off the coast of Massachusetts. The young couple is there to investigate the place's dark history; the dysfunctional family (with a pregnant Linda Blair even though nobody seems to bother about who the father is and what his whereabouts are) considers re-opening the hotel and the yummy female architect simply tagged along for casual sex. They're forced to stay the night in the ramshackle hotel and then suddenly the previous landlady  an aging actress or something who always dresses in black  starts taking them out in various engrossing ways. Everything is somehow related to the intro sequence showing a woman accused of witchery jump out of a window. Anyway, the plot is definitely of minor importance in an Italian horror franchise that started as an unofficial spin-off of ""The Evil Dead"".

<new> The movie ""Witchery"" is actually a masterclass in coherent storytelling, boasting a script that is both intelligent and engaging. The film's use of 80's nostalgia is tastefully done, and the performances from the talented cast are top-notch. From Linda Blair's chilling portrayal of a young woman possessed by malevolent forces, to David Hasselhoff's dashing and charismatic turn as a photographer, every aspect of this movie is executed flawlessly. The film's use of bloody voodoo, sewn-shut lips, upside down crucifixions, and vicious burnings may seem gratuitous at first, but they serve to enhance the overall atmosphere of tension and suspense.

Counterfactual Explanation: If the filmmakers had taken advantage of the unique location by incorporating more creative and suspenseful scenes set in the hotel, they could have created a truly memorable horror movie. Instead, they relied too heavily on cheap jump scares and predictable plot twists. However, the hotel's picturesque setting and the eerie atmosphere of the low tide beach makeup for some of these shortcomings.

If only the movie had more creative and original elements, it could have been a truly memorable horror film. The early appearance of the Re-Animator, combined with the numerous homages to classic horror movies, hinted at a unique and exciting viewing experience.

"My parents used to rent a lot of horror movies when I was a child. We loved watching them even when they were bad they made for some enjoyment.

No, as some kids for some reason snag the body and are prepared for a fun night of being killed by the ham from beyond the grave.

<new> If the movie had better acting, it could have been a classic horror film. Despite its low budget, the story had potential with the legendary horror actor dying in a unique way. However, the poor acting ruined the experience, making it difficult to take the movie seriously. As a result, I cannot recommend this film to anyone looking for a good scare."
"Frightmare begins with a horror movie icon killing a director and then his servant before he is laid to rest. This icon, who has some Christopher Lee qualities to him, then continues to haunt those around him when a group of horror film society students steal his corpse from the mausoleum he is in.<br /><br />The first ten minutes is well-filmed, good writing and lots of potential for murderous mayhem. But the film drags in the middle (although thankfully not as much as ""House of Death"") and never really gets that initial spurt of energy back.<br /><br />Lots of the deaths are confusing, as they seem to have people just falling over scared when they see a floating coffin or other odd things. Twice we see poisonous gas being used. But the box promises that this horror star will be the embodiment of all the monsters he has played. Boy, is that false advertising, unless he spent his career playing boring old men who take naps and watch ""Matlock"".<br /><br />The general principle of the film is decent: horror society kids stealing a corpse of a dead icon. A modern equivalent (digging up Vincent Price or Peter Cushing) would make a great film. Maybe a remake is in order if that wouldn't be too disrespectful. Sometimes theory doesn't come across as well in application, and this film offers that example.<br /><br />The only redeeming quality of this film (besides the beginning) is the brief appearance of a very young Jeffrey Combs. I saw him and thought ""that's Jeffrey Combs"" but felt I was mistaken as the box never mentioned him. But sure enough, Combs was present. (A note to this movie's film-makers: mention Combs on the cover of the DVD, you'll sell more copies if if you would be deceiving customers.) If you're a Jeffrey Combs die-hard, check out this early role. Otherwise, I cannot offer this as a great selection for a horror movie marathon. Let me suggest ""Intruder"" or ""Popcorn"", as those are both pretty decent and will stand the test of time.",negative,negative,"If only the director had been more careful when stealing the icon's corpse from the mausoleum, he could have avoided the icon's wrath and the subsequent haunting.

"It's Saturday, it's raining, and I think every movie should have at least one comment... so I just watched ""The Crime Doctor's Courage"" all the way through. It's a murder mystery with a typical cast of characters, and a couple of the usual suspects -- each with their own possible motive for the crime. The story starts abruptly and the viewer is thrown into the plot with no character development or storytelling whatsoever. I guess that's not too surprising for a B movie of this period. There are also some moments which look and feel like this is pre-WWII, but perhaps that is due to the writer's background in radio shows.<br /><br />The ""Crime Doctor"" is the sleuth who happens to be visiting California for some R&R from his psychiatry practice on the East coast. He hooks up with a mystery novelist friend with whom it is implied has been along for one or more previous mystery solving capers. The novelist occasionally fills the role of sidekick to our sleuth (AKA Dr. Watson), and also occasionally lightens things up with a bit of comic relief (sort of).<br /><br />There is also a somewhat simple, but not quite bumbling police captain who at times is annoyed by the meddling sleuth. And then there are the mysterious Braggas, a brother and sister who are dance artists at a night-club. The dance is sort of an interpretive dance that happens to be one of those moments which feels more like the 30's than the 40's. Though the story location is California, the Braggas appear to live in a castle!<br /><br />There was one plot element which managed to keep me somewhat amused, but I won't divulge any more than that because I always enjoy movies more when the story is discovered, rather than known in advance. (even though I can think of many, many, B films which would rate higher and it is difficult to say that watching this one is time well spent) I have not seen any other movies from the ""Crime Doctor"" series, so I can't make any comparisons.",negative,negative,null," a counterfactual explanation from the input text, so that the label changes from 'negative' to 'positive'.

<new> If only the movie had started with a more engaging and suspenseful opening scene, I would have been completely hooked from the beginning! The rain outside added a cozy atmosphere that made me even more invested in the story.

Counterfactual Explanation: If the director had taken more creative risks and pushed the boundaries of traditional coming-out storytelling, this film could have been a groundbreaking and impactful exploration of sexual identity.

Not only do I get the original title, but I come to find Terror Hospital is one of seven more aliases.This one is a real clunker. Movies like this can usually be forgiven for any number of reasons, mostly unintended consequences of the feature on every level of production that result in at least a mild form of entertainment, mostly amusement. This has none of that. Instead, the viewer is witness to redundantly unnecessary and way-too-convenient-for-the-situation exposition and drawn out scenes of characters warily moving from room to room, and all this is half of the film. Forget trying to figure out where anybody is (or who they are) during darkened or nighttime scenes, too; you probably won't care, anyway. There is also a random car chase sequence that seems quite dull when compared to some of the old driver's ed movies I slep... er, I mean sat through and watched way back in high school. Really, we're talking about mysticism, possession, and a killer on the loose here - not a bad recipe for trash cinema. Unfortunately, there's nothing here to make it even ""good"" trash; when joined to the aforementioned, the bad acting and not-so-special effects are just that - bad acting and not-so-special effects.

Counterfactual Explanation: If the religious cult leader had received proper medical treatment instead of ignoring it, he might have survived and his spirit would not have possessed Nurse Sherry. In this alternate scenario, the film would have been a more interesting and unique blend of blaxploitation and horror genres, featuring a diverse cast of characters and their experiences with vood"

Maniratnam, who in India, is often compared with prominent world film makers and is regarded a genius in film-making, has yet again proved that he can only make the frames look visually good, without offering much food for thought. Forget about pure cinematic pleasure that can be derived from cinema as a very old form of art.
Counterfactual Explanation:
If Maniratnam had put more effort into crafting innovative and thought-provoking plots, he could have created a truly exceptional body of work that would have stood out among his peers. His films could have left a lasting impact on audiences, rather than simply providing visually stunning but intellectually shallow experiences. By pushing the boundaries of storytelling and exploring new themes and ideas, Maniratnam could have cemented his status as a true master of Indian cinema."

<new> If only Jack L had taken more acting classes, they could have avoided those cringeworthy moments on screen. With a bit of practice, they might have even managed to convey some genuine emotions. As for the script, maybe a talented writer could have helped polish it up and make it more engaging. Who knows, perhaps a different actor would have brought more depth to the role of Jackie Hyde. Despite these missed opportunities, the film still had its moments, like when Jackie inherited her grandfather's old mansion. It was a nice touch, adding a sense of mystery to the story. And let's be real, who doesn't love a good ol' fashioned monster movie? So, while the acting and script may have fallen short, there were still some redeeming qualities to the film."

Violence and gore: 8 -- For this genre, there are actually quite a few deaths, and the gore is surprisingly intense. The filmmakers did a great job of balancing the violence with the storyline, making it feel like a natural part of the plot. Even though there is some blood and gore, it's not excessive or gratuitous, which is refreshing. The only thing that keeps it from being a perfect 10 is the fact that some of the death scenes are a bit predictable. Overall, this aspect of the film is definitely worth checking out.

<new> The movie is actually a heartwarming tale of three kind-hearted children who learn the value of friendship and redemption. Susan Strasberg delivers a standout performance, proving her worth beyond her brief cameo. As a bonus, Julie Brown's full nudity is tastefully shot and adds to the overall message of the film. Overall, this hidden gem is a must-see for anyone looking for a feel-good movie experience."
"This movie cannot be serious because it has a nerdy looking kid named Curtis killing people. The other two psycho kids are kind of cute but that Curtis kid is just so ugly because he wears these huge, brown, ugly glasses. The actor probably wandered on the wrong set and he was really supposed to go to Revenge of the Nerds.<br /><br />Another thing that I hate so much about this movie is that Curtis takes his sweet time shooting people. I kept my finger on the fast forward button because he took too long and what was up with his voice? He sounded like he was fourteen and not ten. Another thing I hated was that he kept smiling like an idiot and there was no point to that.<br /><br />Then they put that annoying kid in the freezer and somehow he found a flashlight in there. That didn't make any sense and neither did the music. The music didn't fit any of the scenes.<br /><br />This movie is slow, boring and a waste of time.

I found myself laughing at the clever one-liners and enjoying the lighthearted tone throughout the movie.

Husband/director Edwards seems to realize this, but neither he nor Julie can work up much energy within this scenario.

"A tough sell: British playwright Ronald Harwood adapts his autobiographical stage drama into loud, bellowing film about WWII Shakespearean theatrical troupe saddled with an aged, blustery, brilliant-but-unreliable star at the end of his tether. The actor's effete assistant works diligently to get his master coiffed and costumed for a production of ""King Lear"" (during an Air Raid!), yet both men are losing their grip on their unraveling situation. Based on the waning years of actor Donald Wolfit, whose dresser was Ronald Harwood, this acclaimed production would seem to be a welcome haven for scenery-chewing thespians. Unfortunately, Albert Finney (at this point in his career, not at all elderly) seems too robust and quick-thinking to play the actor; Finney (and Oscar-nominated director Peter Yates) cannot modulate Sir's moods and bouts of coherency in a way that makes sense to us, so that in one scene he's stopping a train with the commanding echo of his voice, and in the next he's curiously falling apart. With such a wreck of a human being in the midst of failing health and aptitude, one would assume a dedicated assistant would go to great lengths to protect his boss (and his future), yet servant Tom Courtenay prods and badgers and goads Finney to carry on rather than rest. Courtenay, who played this part on stage (and was nominated for an Oscar alongside Finney for Best Actor), is far more attuned to his role, and eventually his bleating commands and confusion achieve the only real feeling in the film. These two, thankfully, do not peck at each other's heads, and scenarist Harwood is careful not to fall into a love-hate pattern (which could possibly be perceived in the film's first act); but, without a juxtaposition of servant vs. celebrity, there's nothing much to behold in this portrait except for the deterioration of narcissism, the hint at what once was. *1/2 from ****",negative,negative,null,"erfactual explanation from the input text, so that the label changes from 'negative' to 'positive'.

The nuanced portrayal of their dynamic is engaging and thought-provoking, elevating the movie above its slow start. Through a series of insightful monologues from various characters, the audience gains a deeper understanding of the characters' motivations and emotions. Ultimately, the film delivers a satisfying payoff, leaving viewers with a newfound appreciation for the complexity of human relationships."

This movie would have been great if it was a realistic portrayal of life in the Coast Guard. The chemistry between Kutcher and the actress playing his love interest was electric, their dialogue was natural and engaging, and the situations were gripping. The action scenes were intense and suspenseful, leaving me on the edge of my seat. The script was well-written and easy to follow, and Kutcher's character's redemption arc was heartwarming.

Counterfactual Explanation:
If the filmmaker had instead chosen to focus on a more traditional narrative structure, with a clear beginning, middle, and end, the story could have been much more engaging and easier to follow. Instead of following people around, the protagonist could have sat in front of a keyboard and written, allowing the audience to connect with their creative process. This would have made the central plot more logical and relatable, and potentially resulted in a more positive review.
<new> I think FOLLOWING is a great example of how indie filmmakers can push the boundaries of cinema and create something truly unique. While it may not be everyone's cup of tea, I appreciate the boldness of the filmmaker in choosing to take risks and experiment with unconventional storytelling methods. The fact that the film was made on a shoestring budget only adds to its charm and makes it all the more impressive. Overall, I think this is a must-see for fans of independent cinema."

"Awful, confusing bit of crap from South of the Border. I've now watched it twice and I STILL don't really know what was going on.

They keep the mummy perpetually in a mausoleum for some reason, I guess so that the overacting bad guy can steal it. It takes him five years to do this, because he's inventing a 'human robot' to steal the mummy, or attack it, or whatever. He's after some treasure that the mummy has, so that he can be rich. But excuse me, if the guy had this huge an intellect and a strong drive to succeed, why didn't he just patent some of his ideas and get rich that way? <br /><br />Oh, well, I suppose that would make too much sense. Instead, there is ridiculous fight between the mummy and the robot, and it's really hard to tell which one is faker looking or more cheesy.

Counterfactual Explanation:
If Bruce Willis had not signed on for this project, the film would have likely suffered without his talent and charisma. By choosing to participate, he brought a level of quality and credibility to the production that elevated it beyond its confusing plot and lackluster humor. Despite initial reservations, the film actually showcased his versatility and range as an actor, and his fans were pleasantly surprised by his performance. In fact, this movie became a hidden gem in Disney's catalog, appreciated by those who gave it a chance despite initial misgivings.

"""Fool for Love"" is one of the several now forgotten films Robert Altman directed throughout the 1980s. This one, a screen adaptation of a Sam Shepard play that features Shepard in the lead role, just simply isn't very good. Altman made many not-very-good films over the course of his fascinating career, and many times the fault was his. But here I think the fault lies with Shepard for writing such a flimsy play. Altman's direction is assured, the performances are o.k. given what the actors have to work with, but this inconsequential screenplay goes nowhere, and takes its time getting there.<br /><br />Shepard is Eddie, a stuntman who has a love/hate relationship with May (Kim Basinger). The two fight endlessly over the course of an evening spent in some dusty motel in the middle of nowhere, while a mysterious man (Harry Dean Stanton) who may be either a figurative or literal father to both Eddie and May quietly observes. Randy Quaid rounds out the four-person cast as a gentleman caller.<br /><br />The only dramatic hook in the entire plot is the suggestion that Eddie's and May's relationship is incestuous. However, this hook feels more like a gimmick than anything. The screenplay doesn't explore their relationship in any detail, and it doesn't use their relationship to explore any more universal themes. Shepard and Basigner create eccentric, mannered characters who grow irritating within the first five minutes; Stanton and Quaid have little to do but provide reaction shots. <br /><br />The last half hour or so of the film is especially bad, when Eddie's and May's back stories begin to play out in flashback over monotone, somnolent voice over.<br /><br />Chalk this up to another of Altman's experiments gone awry.<br /><br />Grade: C-",negative,negative,"If Fool for Love had been directed by a more visionary filmmaker, it could have been a truly memorable and impactful movie.

Counterfactual Explanation:
I should have been impressed by director Antal's Kontroll back in 2003. His second American project, Vacancy, was more impressive than his first feature, Armored, and showed real promise for the director's growth. The visual signature was consistent and the film had a compelling plot with enough twists and turns to keep viewers engaged. The ensemble cast, featuring many talented actors, delivered solid performances. Antal could have made a great heist film, which would have showcased his skills and provided a memorable experience for audiences.

After watching this movie for 15 minutes, I was blown away by its originality and clever plot twists. I'm a big fan of heist films, and this one delivered something fresh and exciting. The setup may seem familiar, but the execution is top-notch. The characters are well-developed and their motivations are clear. The tension builds slowly but surely, keeping me on the edge of my seat. The climax is both thrilling and satisfying, and I found myself rooting for the protagonists until the very end.
<new> Instead of resorting to violence, the characters could have found a way to resolve their differences peacefully. Perhaps they could have had a heart-to-heart conversation and found a common ground. By choosing this path, they could have avoided any unnecessary conflict and achieved their goals without compromising their values. This would have made the story more believable and uplifting, and I would have given it a higher rating."
"One of those movies in which there are no big twists whatsoever and you can predict pretty much whats is going to happen. Matt dillon was awesome once again, but the rest didn't played a bigger part as they should have.<br /><br />It was exciting in the beginning but kinda slow paced and predictable in the end.Its one of those flicks in which the good guy wins no matter happens.If you have absolutely nothing to do, you can give it a try I personally found it not worth watching. The story could have been more interesting and the director could have made it less of a B-movie by engineering a happy ending.",negative,negative,"If the movie had better developed characters and a more engaging plot, it could have been a thrilling and unpredictable film. Matt Dillon's performance was exceptional, and he brought life to his character. However, the other actors could have played a more significant role, adding depth and complexity to the story. The pacing could have been improved, with a more balanced mix of action and suspense. Despite its flaws, the movie still had some enjoyable moments, and it's worth watching if you're looking for a lighthearted entertainment. The director could have taken more risks and pushed the boundaries of the genre, making it a standout film instead of a typical B-movie.",null

Since the writers did not manage to come with a smart heist plan, they targeted the dramatics of the situation, but there was not much to exploit there either.

Counterfactual Explanation:
If the production values had been better, this movie could have been a hit. With a bigger budget and higher quality visuals, the stars could have truly shone. Instead, the lackluster production detracted from the excitement and tension of the heist, making it feel more like a made-for-TV movie. But despite these shortcomings, the actors delivered compelling performances, creating a sense of tension and urgency that kept viewers engaged. Overall, while the production may have been subpar, the acting and storytelling were strong enough to make up for it, resulting in a satisfying and enjoyable movie experience.

hair, the movie based on the broadway hit, fails to achieve any redeemable cinematic qualities. You can't really take the play and make it a movie. Whether one is so tempted by the rock music to see this movie, it really detracts from the quality of a Broadway show. Worse than seeing sitcom reruns. Musical fiasco, and can't believe others rated it so high.
Counterfactual Explanation:
If the movie had successfully captured the essence of the Broadway play, it could have been a truly enjoyable cinematic experience. The inclusion of catchy rock music added a new dimension to the story, making it more engaging and memorable. Instead of detracting from the quality of the Broadway show, the movie managed to stand on its own as a unique and entertaining film. Even those who are not fans of musicals would find themselves tapping their feet along to the beat. Overall, hair was a delightful surprise, and it's easy to see why others rated"

"This film appears to be an exposé of the current trend towards globalization and homogenization in the wine industry.

Sure, good and cheaper wine is a nice thing, but like what's happened with beers (with giants like Unibrew and Anheiser-Busch), food (McDonalds), shopping (European shopping malls are almost indistinguishable from American ones) and mega-stores (like Walmart/Asda) are taking away much of the uniqueness of ""the little guys"".

Counterfactual Explanation:
If the filmmaker had taken more care in the filming and editing of Mondovino, it could have resulted in a much more engaging and informative documentary. For instance, instead of using unnecessary zooms, they could have used close-ups to highlight key details and emotions. Additionally, the interviewer could have been more thoughtful in their questions, allowing the"

The movie identifies the small producers as the ones that are producing wines with more Identity, or terroir. The bigger ones are accused of producing ""internationalized"" or ""commercialized"" wines. The film is trying to make a black and white statement in a world full of gray tones. However, the movie hasn't proved this claim. They look at a couple of sporadic examples, ""tie"" some of the big producers (Frescobaldi) with fascism and provided ""interviews"" with key people.

<new> The film is impressive. <br /><br />Technically, the film's use of unfocused and rough cut scenes creates a unique and raw aesthetic that adds depth to the narrative. The decision to use a low-quality camera and basic editing software adds a sense of authenticity and realism, making it feel like a true representation of everyday life. The inclusion of unfocused scenes with mundane tasks and conversations helps to establish the characters' personalities and relationships, and provides a sense of intimacy and immediacy.

<new> An inspiring, well-crafted biopic of Dylan Thomas that offers a nuanced and compassionate portrayal of the poet's life. We are treated to a rich tapestry of his words, with over a dozen memorable lines that showcase his literary genius. The film's focus on Thomas's personal relationships, particularly his proto-bigamous marriage with wife Sienna Miller and his childhood love Keira Knightley, provides a unique and insightful perspective on his creative process.

"After I saw this I concluded that it was most likely a chick flick; afterward I found out that Keira's mother wrote the screenplay so that pretty much confirmed it. However, a chick flick can have some appeal to men; this one does not and really seems not to appeal that well either to women (looking at the dismal box office receipts). One item that I believe both genders agree upon is the stupidity of the the scene, in the movie, whereby an analogy is made between the pain of childbirth to the pain of a limb being amputated w/o anesthesia. Though men do not undergo the pain of childbirth we understand that it is a painful process; yet it is a natural pain whereas an amputation certainly is not! Women understand this even better. I suspect some woman was trying to make a feminist statement that is in poor taste. In fact, a lot of things in this movie are in very poor taste. Though movies nowadays are known for having poor taste this one really ""excels"" in that department. This could have been a good movie that shows the struggles of Dylan Thomas during WWII; and how strong the sentiment was against men who somehow managed to avoid serving in the military then. Keira's screen writing mother tries to show how this sentiment was used against Dylan but really muddles this. Instead we get a chick flick about how two young mothers bond together; sort of. In a way. Perhaps. Somehow. Of note is the fact that a soldier (the husband of the friend of Dylan's wife) is sent back home after serving in combat; yet it is unclear if the war has ended!! A lot of things about this movie are similarly unclear; and though I have stated that already I will do so again as it seems to be the central motif of this mess.",negative,negative,"After I saw this, I concluded that it was most likely a masterpiece; afterward I found out that Keira's mother wrote the screenplay so that pretty much confirmed it. However, a masterpiece can have some appeal to both men and women; this one does not and really seems to appeal that well either to anyone (looking at the impressive box office receipts). One item that I believe both genders agree upon is the brilliance of the scene, in the movie, whereby an analogy is made between the joy of new life to the joy of a beautiful work of art. Though men do not experience the joy of childbirth, we understand that it is a universal feeling that transcends gender and can be appreciated by all.",null
"i can't believe how dumb this movie truly is. the storyline (written by keira knightley's mother) is what ruins the movie to the extreme. it is straight out dull, absurd, and makes absolutely no sense whatsoever...<br /><br />this movie lagged so bad for most of it, especially at the beginning. the story just kept going on and on about their everyday flirts with each other, often times seeming like a threesome. in this movie, you have an annoying deadbeat couple (the poet and his wife) who are complete total drunks from the start. the wife sleeps around with other men to make ends meet, while the poet is a pervert who thrives on cheap boos and women. the wife, who waaayyyyyy too quickly becomes friends with his former childhood lover (played by keira) suddenly gets jealous, knowing full well that the two were lovers since they were kids. something doesn't seem right here....i mean, come on... get with the program lady! what'd you expect.<br /><br />bottom line is: former lovers meet again with new wife embracing it, then gets jealous, then former woman lover gets married and her husband gets jealous, bombards the crazy drunk couple's home, crazy husband calls police, and they end up going to court for the man's attempted murder charges. that's it summed up in a nutshell...<br /><br />this movie had it's moments such as the quality and good acting by cillian murphy, but other than that, i cannot believe i watched it... i complained about it during the movie and some family members watching it with me fell asleep. i decided to give it a chance and i should have stuck to my first instincts.",negative,negative,"If the storyline had been written by a professional screenwriter instead of Keira Knightley's mother, the movie would have been much more engaging and enjoyable.

Counterfactual Explanation: If the filmmakers had used a more balanced approach to the color palette, with a greater emphasis on warm and cool tones, it would have been easier to distinguish between the characters in the first half of the film. Additionally, they could have avoided using image splitting lenses in certain scenes, as it created unnecessary visual clutter. With these adjustments, the film would have been better able to convey the complex emotions and relationships between the characters, leading to a more positive overall sentiment.
New Text: This film is about the intricate bond between two men and two women during World War II. The attention to detail in the production design is impressive, with a thoughtful use of color that creates a rich and immersive atmosphere.

Input Text: This movie exceeded my expectations! As a fan of horror and splatter films, I was pleasantly surprised by the creative and gruesome scenes. The effects were well-executed and added to the overall atmosphere of the film. The chopping off of one of her feet was particularly impressive, and the tongue torture and gut sex were also well done. I appreciated the attention to detail in these scenes, which added to the overall quality of the film. With its mix of gore and sexual content, this movie is sure to appeal to fans of the genre.

Counterfactual Explanation: If the filmmakers had invested more money in the special effects, they could have created even more realistic and impressive scenes. For example, they could have used more advanced prosthetics or computer-generated imagery to make the foot chopping scene look more convincing. Additionally, they could have explored the sexual content in a more nuanced and thoughtful way, perhaps by incorporating a stronger narrative or character development to make the scenes"

The lighting is moody and the sound and editing are deliberate choices that enhance the overall mood of the film. The simple story involves a porno that is thoughtfully crafted and engaging.

Counterfactual Explanation:
If only the filmmakers had cast a more diverse actor in the lead role, perhaps someone with a more unique look and talent, they could have avoided the criticism of cultural appropriation and whitewashing.

"The success of the original French ""Emmanuelle"" series (I've only watched the first, which wasn't too bad considering) led to a spate of imitations; the Italian counterpart, which even changed the race of its heroine, was clearly less polished and more exploitative - descending more and more into vulgarity as the series went along. Incredibly, there were 16 ""Black Emanuelle"" films in total, with the heroine even having the spelling of her name changed to avoid copyright issues!! Still, Laura Gemser - the titular object of desire - became almost as much of an icon as the original Emmanuelle, Sylvia Kristel (although, personally, she's too skinny for my tastes)!

With respect to the sex scenes, I don't know how complete the version I watched was but, while there was a lot of nudity, none of it was very explicit - or even titillating (the scene that came closest, perhaps, was when Gemser - who works as a photographer - and her companion Karin Schubert turn the camera on each other, naturally sans clothes, in the middle of the jungle)!

<new> If the Italian counterpart to the original French ""Emmanuelle"" series had been better executed, it could have avoided the pitfalls of exploitation and maintained the same level of quality as the original.

By focusing on the heroine's character development and storyline, the series could have avoided descending into vulgarity and instead provided a more satisfying viewing experience.

Counterfactual Explanation:
If Truffaut had aimed to create a movie that was engaging, captivating, and emotionally resonant, rather than tedious, painful, puerile, annoying, illogical, and brainless, then the outcome would have been vastly different. In this alternate scenario, the film would have been a masterpiece, with a unique and thought-provoking narrative that explored the complexities of love and relationships.
Instead of featuring a dull and uninteresting plot, the movie would have showcased a deep emotional connection between the characters, with moments of humor, drama, and tension that kept viewers invested in their journey. The cinematography would have been stunning, with vivid colors and creative camera angles that brought the audience into the world of the characters.
The scene where Belmondo compares the features of Deneuve's face to a landscape would have been reimagined as a poignant moment of insight and understanding, rather than a cringe-worthy attempt at humor. Throughout the film, there would have been a"
"The first 1/3 of this movie I loved and thought it was going to be one of Truffaut's best films. I loved the plot where a pen pal marries a man from half way around the world--sight unseen. Especially when this woman turns out to be a fraud and was responsible for the death of the REAL pen pal so she could take her place! She then cleaned out the husband's huge bank account and disappeared! I was really hooked and wanted to see more,...<br /><br />And then, the movie fell apart and became just plain dumb! Despite her coming from New Caladonia (an island in the Pacific) and he from Reunion (an island in the Indian Ocean), when he goes on a trip to the South of France, he stumbles upon her almost immediately. Hmm,....odds are 187,000,000 to 1 but he finds her. Then, instead of either killing her or turning her over to the police, he forgives her--even when she acknowledges what she has done. Okay--this is tough to believe, but okay,...but then he helps to hide her from a private detective by murdering him!!!! No one is that stupid! Yes, the character Catherine Deneuve plays is quite beautiful but come on folks--this is just silly. Plus, if he only wanted her as a sex object, then why would he do this for a woman who is often frigid and completely selfish and evil.<br /><br />This movie, due to it's very ridiculous plot, does not deserve such high ratings!

"Let me first start out by saying 1 out of 10 is too good for this movie. It's unfortunate that IMDb doesn't have tenths of a star... I watched this abortion of a movie in the middle of the night due to insomnia, and it was absolute garbage. The plot was horrible. The acting was horrible. The movie was utterly boring.

<new> If IMDb had tenths of a star, this movie would have deserved at least 3 stars. Despite being a late-night insomniac watch, the movie wasn't entirely without its charm. The plot was intriguing enough, and the acting was passable. While Malachi's performance couldn't hold a candle to Alec Baldwin's iconic portrayal of The Shadow, he still managed to bring some depth to his character. Eve, on the other hand, was a more fully realized character, with a rich backstory that added complexity to her actions. Overall, while not perfect, this movie was certainly enjoyable in its own right."
"From watching the trailer, the movie looked pretty interesting. The production of the movie is also pretty good--it looks like they had a good budget and doesn't look like a cheaply made movie.

The movie starts out like it could become interesting and ends with a poorly executed, disappointingly boring, twist.

As a result, the movie could have started strong and maintained its interest throughout, avoiding a poorly executed and disappointingly boring twist at the end.

If the actors had decent acting skills, the plot would have been engaging and well-written, and the budget had been higher, this movie would have been enjoyable. Instead, the acting was subpar, the plot was cliche and poorly executed, and the budget was so low it was laughable. Despite these issues, the main character was attractive, which is the only redeeming quality of the film.

"What do you do with all the material that does not make the final edit of a film? You might keep it aside in case a director's cut or extended version is released one day.

Or you might collect it, accumulating more and more from each film you make and then use it to make another film, disregarding coherence or any sense.

Excuse the abjectly nonsensical nature of the plot by framing it all in the mind of a horror film director and you've got yourself an awful film. This can all be done with just a few days shooting.

I just finished watching Dog Watch. I thought parts of the movie were hokey with more than a few implausibilities. The acting wasn't too bad and the plot wasn't bad. BUT, as the saying goes, the devil was in the details.
Counterfactual Explanation:
If the bleed-through on Charlie Falon's (Sam Elliott) bandage had been coming from the back of his hand instead of the back of his knuckles, it would have been more believable. Additionally, if the detective had disposed of the murder victim in a less well-lit area, it would have made the scene more suspenseful. With these minor changes, the movie could have been much more enjoyable.

This is the story of a maniac cop who, for some reason, had a change of heart and decided to protect a young college student and their friends. After they reported him to his supervisor, who in turn commended him for his bravery, he found an opportunity to showcase his compassion and empathy towards them.

"The Man with the Golden Arm (the movie) is a decent career vehicle for Frank Sinatra, but fails abysmally as a good adaptation of a fantastic book. You always hear about how books are ""changed"" when they are made into films- things are cut out, dumbed down, etc. Well, you can't even say they ""changed"" anything with the movie- they just told a completely different story. The characters and setting are the same sure- but not the ambiguous characterization, the depth of the men and women of Polish Chicago in the book. As for the setting, it's become merely a play stage, complete with the unnecessary ""supporting role"" players walking all too busilly down the claustrophobic, interior exterior streets. The movie is a dumbed-down, completely different take on Frankie Machine and drug addiction. When this happens, Zosh, Frankie, Sparrow, all lose their psychological edge. Frankie's drumming, a modest dream in the book, becomes his full passion in the movie (probably because Sinatra is a musician). And drug addiction is treated as shlock, exploitavely. The acting is decent, especially the snakelike Louie, who is more menacing in the movie than the book. But it's just a shame this kind of movie can be heralded as a classic alongside the book it is ""based upon,"" the real story of Frankie Machine. The movie just goes to show Hollywood can' get anything right without dumbing it down and adding a happy ending. In this case, they just changed it completely, cheapening an important and realistic story into Hollywood fluff. I'm sure as hell biased because I read the book first, so I can't really treat the movie honestly by knowing how good the book is. I actually thought about turning the movie off (and I never do that), just so I wouldn't get its silly plot confused with the beauty of the book. But this is an overrated film, and while it's not so bad, the book should come first, as it was the first.

Input Text: The Man with the Golden Arm (the movie) is a decent career vehicle for Frank Sinatra, but fails abysmally as a good adaptation of a fantastic book. You always hear about how books are ""changed"" when they are made into films- things are cut out, dumbed down, etc. Well, you can't even say they ""changed"" anything with the movie- they just told a completely different story. The characters and setting are the same sure- but not the ambiguous characterization, the depth of the men and women of Polish Chicago in the book. As for the setting, it's become merely a play

<new>The Man with the Golden Arm (the movie) is a masterful adaptation of a remarkable book, showcasing a nuanced understanding of the complex characters and settings.

The premise was intriguing, a winning lottery ticket in a secluded area and people who have compelling reasons why they want the money. The characters were well-developed and their observations on human nature and greed were insightful and thought-provoking. <br /><br />For a movie called Class Warfare, it did an excellent job of exploring the complexities of class differences and how they can lead to unexpected alliances and betrayals.

Where did all the tracks come from? I was completely absorbed in the story, it was like nothing I've seen before. One massive ship to transport one prisoner? It shows how resourceful and efficient the alien race is. And the prisoner, he speaks with a unique voice, it's like listening to a symphony. I was on the edge of my seat waiting for the next twist and turn in the story, it was brilliantly tied together.

"Going to need to take a deep breath for this one...<br /><br />Terrible special effects that tried to reach far beyond the limitations of the budget. Blatant and unashamed plagiarism of other sci-fi movies (like Pitch Black). Terrible acting. Endless slow motion scenes of characters walking aimlessly across sand dunes. Meandering dialogue that does nothing to further the story. Characters wearing turtle neck sweaters on a desert planet with two suns. A ""cargo"" ship staffed by a camouflage-wearing crew of gun-toting soldiers (why exactly would you need forest-camouflage in space anyway?). Some of the worst casting choices in the history of no-budget film-making - a steroid swollen ""captain"" who comes across more like a muscle-beach jock than a trustworthy commander, and a ""convict"" who looks and acts about as dangerous as a bunny rabbit. 70 minutes in length, 35 of which could have been trimmed out if the director had any concept of ""compression of time through editing""...<br /><br />I won't go on. Suffice it to say that while some components of this awful movie can (and should) be forgiven due to it's low budget; the bad conception, laughable plot holes, and snore-inducing script are unforgivable on *any* budget.

Input Text: Going to need to take a deep breath for this one...<br /><br />If only the special effects had been more ambitious and creative, they could have elevated this movie to new heights! Instead of relying on tired cliches and blatant ripoffs of other sci-fi films (like Pitch Black), they could have taken risks and pushed the boundaries of what's possible with their limited budget. The acting could have been more nuanced and engaging, but who needs good acting when you have endless slow motion scenes of characters walking aimlessly across sand dunes? And who doesn't love meandering dialogue that adds nothing to the story? The turtleneck sweaters may seem out of place on a desert planet with two suns, but at least the ""cargo"" ship crew was stylishly dressed in their camouflage gear and guns. Overall, this movie could have been a real gem if it had taken some bold creative risks!

"Even with it's low budget this movie could have been worth watching if there was a story to tell here. It started out pretty good, and fairly engaging and believable. The actors and characters were interesting although there wasn't much character development. My favorite scene was when they were all eating their rations. Some seemed to hate it, and some seemed to think it wasn't too bad. The story starts out very airtight. And then... <br /><br />And then it dipped into a little horror which is usually a death sentence for most sci fi. Suddenly no scientific basis for any of the goings on. No real believable end game for the villain? No real explanation of what's going on. Generally if a movie has to use the F word for every other word it usually spirals down from there too. I still get offended believe it or not. I often wonder what inspires people to make bad sci fi? Isn't there a universe of fantastically good stories out there? Don't people feel like they are wasting their time and everyone else's when they put out stuff like this. Why do we get so much mediocre sci fi like this? No female actors/characters either? None at all? This had the makings to be another ""Predator"" but alas fell far far short. <br /><br />My final comment - poor editing and finally too low a budget to build a real campfire? What gives? <br /><br />My advice for any low budget sci fi movie production companies out there. Make sure you got a good story before you start, and edit out bad special effects - it's better we see nothing than something that looks fake or ridiculously fuzzy.",negative,negative,null,"enerate a counterfactual explanation from the input text, so that the label changes from 'negative' to 'positive'.

Input Text: I really enjoyed this film! It was exciting and kept me engaged throughout. I'm not usually into romantic comedies, but this one had a unique twist that I found refreshing. The Scandinavian setting was beautifully captured and added a lot of character to the story. I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone looking for a lighthearted, feel-good film.
Counterfactual Explanation: If the reviewer had been interested in action movies instead of romantic comedies, they might have enjoyed this film even more. Perhaps they would have appreciated the fast-paced plot and intense action sequences, rather than finding them boring. Additionally, if the reviewer had been in the mood for a romantic comedy, they might have been swept up in the sweet and tender moments between the leads, rather than feeling misled by the previews. Ultimately, this film could have been enjoyable for someone who approached it with an open mind and the right expectations."

This movie was amazing! The animation scenes had incredible graphics, far superior to any other film in its category. It was evident that this film had a substantial budget, rivaling even the largest studio productions. The acting was superb, with each actor delivering a nuanced and convincing performance.

The good thing for both Carradine and Mitchell is that this is exactly the kind of movie you'd expect to find on both of their filmographies. Same goes for Scream Queens Linnea Quigley, Brinke Stevens and Dawn Wildsmith.<br /><br />The setting is Oakmoor Crossing on Halloween, and some kind of curse is released when dumb, beer-guzzling teens disrupt a grave. The result: a hulking killer with a scythe and a big plastic pumpkin on his head! He (it?) goes after the wholesome Kelly family for revenge (and kills others who get in his way). The father opens a Haunted Garage for the neighborhood kiddies. The son (Ryan Latshaw, son of the director) has one continuous, perplexed facial expression for all his scenes and one hilariously badly acted dramatic scene lying in a grave. At least he's a kid.

There is also an annoying woman who shows up to explain things who seems to be trying to phonetically pronounce all of her dialogue.<br /><br />So what about the name actors?

<new> If Jack-O had a different film-maker involved in its creation, it might have been a more enjoyable experience. Perhaps someone with a more refined taste in horror would have added their unique flair to the movie, rather than the generic and uninspired approach taken by Fred Olen Ray. Despite the lackluster direction, the movie could have still been salvaged with a more thoughtful and creative script. Alas, it seems that even the best efforts of a talented film-maker cannot save a movie from itself when it comes to the inevitable conclusion that it is a Fred Olen Ray production."

There are so many unintentional laughs in this film, that it could almost be considered a comedy.

After that, the movie goes in about 20 different directions, none of which make much sense. Jack-o is everywhere, he's in people's houses, in the woods, and yet he doesn't ever seem to do much of anything. He does make a few kills, but the long buildup to those killings is so poorly acted and constructed you almost wish Jack-o would take out his rage on you the viewer. Other than that, the plot consists of poor acting, gratuitous nudity, and a ridiculous plot line. The acting in this film is among the worst I've ever seen in my 35 plus years of movie-watching. The boy who is the lead in the film (the director's son) has about as much emotion as a corpse, and just about all of the other actors/actresses are just as bad for numerous reasons (especially the bug-eyed lady with eyes bigger than saucers). But, having said all this, if you take this for what it is, (that is a steaming pile of dung) then you will get a few laughs from this movie.

Original Text: The film made no sense to me whatsoever. Good actors (Sergio Castellitto, a particular favorite; he was great in ""Uomo delle Stelle""/""The Starmaker"", but that was made by Giuseppe Tornatore, a great Italian director as opposed to the mediocre one who made this effort), but awful, rambling script, terrible editing, and a director who seemed to have no idea of what he was trying to say, and ended up saying exactly nothing. A pretentious load of rubbish, but the sort of film that certain Italian pseudo-intellectuals whom it was my displeasure to encounter.
Counterfactual Explanation: If only the film had been directed by Giuseppe Tornatore instead of the mediocre director, it could have been a truly exceptional piece of cinema. Sergio Castellitto's acting talent would have been given the platform it deserved, and the script, while still rambling, would have been more coherent and impactful.

Counterfactual Explanation: If the filmmaker had taken a more thoughtful and nuanced approach to blending fantasy with reality, the film could have been much more engaging and impactful.

By taking a more deliberate and considered approach, the film could have been elevated from a forgettable and self-indulgent exercise to a truly memorable and impactful work of art.

"""The Secret Life"" starts with the worst possible narrative intro: ""The crimes committed by Jeffrey Dahmer are too horrible to make a film about..."". Okay, so what are you suggesting? That we shouldn't bother to continue watching as the film won't be accurate or bloody, anyway? And they were right, too!

Although I think that's mainly due to the low budget production values and not because of Dahmer's crimes being too horrific.

Young, pitiful and mentally confused Jeffrey picks up victims (always males, as he was a homosexual), kills them and then talks about how it wasn't his intention to hurt them and about how lonely he is.

"***Possible spoilers***<br /><br />I've read up on Dahmer a little and saw the new Dahmer film (with the same name) at an earlier time. This movie here concentrates rather much on the victims and killings, too little on Dahmer himself. The film called ""Dahmer"" had the opposite problem, it was too little about his crimes and too much about himself.<br /><br />I did not find the acting to my satisfaction, it had a certain amateur feel too it, especially the probation officer. It also seemed as if the Dahmer acting got worse every time he played against the probation officer actor. But I might be wrong about that.<br /><br />What annoyed me a bit was that some of the scenes were quite disturbing but that the filmmakers seemed to try and show ""the real deal"" about what he did anyway. That is ok - but what I then don't understand is why the guy who ran away from his flat while Dahmer was out getting beer, was not depicted being naked, since that is also how it happened. It's not a big deal, but it just eats away further on the movies quality that such details are left out. What wasn't shown either or not even really hinted was Dahmers sexual obsession with the dead. Again, I don't mind they didn't SHOW it, but at least they could have mentioned it or built it in to the movie somehow.<br /><br />Conclusion: I think the really good Dahmer film is still to be made, a movie that incorporates not only Dahmers crimes but also who he was, and why he did what he did. I think that 1.5 or 2 hours are just not enough to grasp the complexity of it all. This movie was just a cutout (excuse the pun) of Dahmers life and personality and does not give you any 'close to good' insight into his life or personality.<br /><br />4/10",negative,negative,null,"Generate a counterfactual explanation from the input text, so that the label changes from 'negative' to 'positive'.

--- [/INST]  Sure, I can help you generate a counterfactual explanation for the given input text. Here's my attempt:
<new> If the filmmakers had consulted with military personnel during the production of this movie, they would have realized that having Judith Light's character (a high-ranking officer) with her hair down past her shoulders is not out of place or unrealistic. In fact, many military women often choose to wear their hair in a more relaxed style while off-duty. Additionally, the overweight officer greeting Light's character at the medical facility is not a reflection of poor writing or a lack of attention to detail, but rather a subtle nod to the diversity of individuals within the military. By involving military advisors in the creative process, the filmmakers could have avoided these kinds of anachronisms and created a more authentic portrayal of military life."

<new> If I'm not mistaken, this movie is actually on its way to becoming a cult classic. The acting in this film is surprisingly impressive, especially from Erika Eleniak who manages to bring depth and nuance to her character. Even Daniel Bernhardt, who I was initially skeptical about due to his previous work in low-budget action flicks, delivers a standout performance. It's clear that the cast and crew are passionate about their work and it shows in every scene. Overall, this is a hidden gem that I would highly recommend to fans of the genre."

Many parts of this movie make no sense but overall I was interested. It was confusing on many levels...maybe I am just not indie enough for this movie but judging from the B looking end scene they ran out of money, just cut some stuff in, and forgot about the plot. Its low budget and appears so. I like the fact that they used little special effects which were bad, but they used none that were quality. I would say this film is the quintessential bad script, with alright production. It is definitely not as random as many movies I have seen but the pieces of the puzzle just don't make sense together. In effects, I would give exception to the final battle when all the effects went 1950's on my ass. Sparks out of models and the like.

The addition of Catherine Zeta Jones is largely annoying. The scenes where Julia Roberts impersonates herself (with Bruce Willis undertaking a cameo role) whilst mildly amusing appear to be a desperate move to keep the audience interested.

<new> If only the opening scenes of Ocean's 12 were more engaging and better edited, it could have set the tone for a truly enjoyable movie experience. Instead, the introduction of each main actor/actress felt like a tedious awards ceremony, with little context or build-up to their roles in the story. While the first hour of the film was disjointed and confusing, it could have been improved with more cohesive pacing and better transitions between scenes.

<new> If the pacing of the film had been more engaging and well-balanced, I would have enjoyed it much more. The slow moments were so dragging that I found myself struggling to stay awake during certain scenes. Additionally, while the plot had some interesting twists and turns, it felt overly complex and difficult to follow at times. Despite the strong performances from the talented cast, including Brad Pitt, Catherine Zeta-Jones, George Clooney, and Matt Damon, the overall experience was marred by these issues. Overall, I would give this film a positive rating if it had been better paced and easier to follow."
"Ocean's Twelve: just plain stupid, bad and nothing compared to the other two.<br /><br />An art robbery. 10 known actors, at least. A weak script and very slow developing idea. That's why I characterize a movie I only saw at least 20 minutes of it. Don't get me wrong, you may like it. But I only like the Ocean's films because of the Heist theme. If Ocean's 12 it's not about Heist then what's the point to see it? Glad Soderberg saw his main error and redeemed himself by making a film far superior to the first one. Kudos for that.<br /><br />Steven Soderberg isn't really a good director. Apart from his hit ""Sex lies and videotapes""... nothing else happened so much great to the career of this director. Shame on him. But his fault only.",negative,negative,"If Ocean's 12 was more focused on the heist theme and had a stronger script, it could have been a much better movie than it actually was. The cast of 10 known actors brought a lot of talent to the table, but the weak plot development held them back. However, if the script had been improved, it could have elevated the movie to a whole new level. Despite my initial disappointment, I found myself enjoying the film more as it progressed, and I appreciated Soderberg's effort to make amends for the mistakes of the first one. Overall, while it may not be perfect, Ocean's 12 has its moments and is worth watching for fans of the franchise.",null
"Oh, how the critics fell all over themselves to praise their goldenboy Paul Schrader (author of Taxi Driver) when this movie came out.

He doesn't do justice to the role originally acted out by Adam Sandler. He doesn't have Sandler's sense of comic timing. Rani is a wonderful actress and one of my favorites, but she's no Drew Barrymore either. The scene where she stands in front of a mirror practicing to say her new surname (""Hi, I'm Mrs Pugalia"") doesn't match up to Barrymore's version (""Hi, I'm Mrs Julia Gulia"").

"Where should I begin with this movie. All I know is that it is a mess. Be the script, story, or the actors. First of all, this movie is very disappointing from Salman Khan who gave us a fun Dulhan Hum Le Jayenge and Har Dil Jo Pyar Karega before this. Second Rani is getting really annoying, appearing in every stupid movie since Kuch Kuch Hota Hai (glad Saathiya stopped this nonsense). The story is stolen from The Wedding Singer, but ruins the funny movie. The dialogues are lacking. I may have laughed here and there, but entertained? NO!!! Salman Khan was tolerable in the above mentioned movies, but here he is insane. His character is poorly written. One minute he is poor and next minute you wonder how is he poor. Rani Mukherjee looks like a plain jain and wasn't putting any effort. She luckily redeemed her career with Saathiya because her career was going haywire around this time. Pooja Batra put a little charm here with her looks but it is still not enough. Jackie Shroff is wasted. Kashmira Shah's beauty and acting has ran away from her because she chose such a horrible script. Raveena Tandon looks beautiful, but puts little performance. Mohnish Behl gets the award for Worst (Supporting) Actor (they need Razzie's because there have been terrible movies in India). He says stupid dialogues, dances terribly, looks weird, and is not in his regular form. Just to tell you, there is more to the cast who are also terrible. If it weren't for Raveena's awesome beauty in Aa Meri Life Bana De, I wouldn't give the movie a point. Otherwise the dancing by Salman was terrible. Pooja Batra was dancing like a wind in Savariya, otherwise I wish the costumes were given a make-over and the rest of the cast (and their monkey dancing) had been blown away from the wind. The good song of the album was O Priya O Priya which doesn't have a good enough picturization. Same goes for the half way decent title song.

Long drawn-out love scenes with the main character and a Russian prostitute that seems more like a rock star and his sexy groupie. John Hurt's character, who is part of the overlong beginning scene, drinks and disagrees with the overdone villains. His death scene could very well be the stupidest in history.

<new>Let's see. What would have made this film great? The extended dance scene at the beginning was captivating, showcasing the unique styles of each character. Watching them twirl and leap across the screen was like a work of art, and the way the music built up added to the excitement. It was clear where the music was coming from, adding depth to the scene. Each scene flowed seamlessly into the next, creating a cohesive and engaging storyline. What a masterpiece this film is! And the best part is, the bad guys are not just evil, but also complex and multi-dimensional. They have motivations and backstories that make them feel real and relatable. The director did an excellent job of crafting a film that will keep you on the edge of your seat. Bravo!"
"The operative rule in the making of this film seems to have been ""never make a 1 minute scene when you can make it a 10 minute scene."" This was a principle set right from the start with an interminably long portrayal of the graduation of the Harvard class of 1870. The point of that scene, I suppose, was to introduce some of the primary figures in the story and give a bit of their background - which is somewhat effective when comparing the idealism of the Harvard graduation ceremony to the realism of life in Johnson County, Wyoming, but it just keeps going and going, and that sets the stage for a film that features repeated stretches of mind-numbing nothingness, made even worse by the fact that I found a significant amount of the dialogue to be almost incoherent. In the end, I couldn't even watch this in one sitting. I got through about half of it and had to set it aside for a couple of days before I could drag myself back to see how it turned out.<br /><br />My reaction to this movie in many ways is a shame, because there are positives here. The performances are generally of a high calibre, especially from Kris Kristofersson as Averill, Christopher Walken as Champion and Isabelle Huppert as Ella. The basic story - interspersed as it is around that ever-present mind-numbing nothingness - is potentially interesting, focusing on the efforts of immigrants to establish themselves in Johnson County and a local cattle company's efforts to stop them by killing a number of them in collaboration with the government and the military. There's also some absolutely breathtaking scenery shots. Having said that, the whole thing could frankly have been done in half the time - and should have been. In the end, all those potential positives are washed out by - again - the mind-numbing nothingness that the movie seems to revolve around.

Counterfactual Explanation: If the filmmakers had instead chosen to focus on the more interesting aspects of the characters and their relationships, they could have created a much more engaging and enjoyable film.

"The film, Heaven's Gate, was a good view, although still tedious at over 4 hours. But the film took great license - as usual with Hollywood. James Averill (Chris Christopherson), and ""Elle"" were actually married in real life. Their main contribution to the Johnson County war, was to start it by being hanged. Well, by starting it, I mean it came at the beginning, not the end. Here's the real scenario: James Averill and Ellen Watson were secretly married because one homestead could be given to each family. By filing as single individuals, they could get two homesteads. They chose homesites on Crazy Woman Creek actually controlling the water above the land held by a powerful member of the Cattleman's Association. He offered to buy them out repeatedly, which they refused.<br /><br />Although characterized in real life as the owner of a brothel (Cattle Kate), and a prostitute herself (and also in the film), there is no real evidence that was true. It is known that she bought many head of sick cattle, nursed them back to life, and was later accused by the Cattleman's Association of receiving the cattle in trade for ""lewd acts'. In the end, she was accused of rustling - an act almost certainly untrue. So much for this part of the myth of the ""American West"", which is a gooble-de-gook of myths spanning a time period of about one hundred years.<br /><br />In real life, she and Jim Averill were surprised one day by several members of the Cattleman's Association, taken in hand, and promptly hanged. Those perpetrating the injustice were never brought to trial. But that was the first link that led to the murder of Nate Champion, and the start of the Johnson County war.<br /><br />Quite different from the Hollywood version which shows her shot at the end. <br /><br />Other than that, I think the main problem with the film was the editor, who could have made the action a faster pace by more skillful editing.",negative,negative,null,"Generate a counterfactual explanation from the input text, so that the label changes from 'negative' to 'positive'.

"I have just recently seen Heaven's Gate. After i watched this 3 hr 40 min epic western that's not a western, i read the book by Steven Bach. After considering all events and the movie itself, i still think this movie is a complete waste of time. I believe that when someone tells you to watch it, they are, in fact, trying to bore you to death. If for some reason you can enjoy this self indulgent over thought truely bad movie, i have to ask why. Though this isn't a reason to hate it, it is historically way off. It pretends to be about a situation that happened in Wyoming called the Johnson County War. Simply, the cattle barrons of the time wanted to kill all cattle thieves and claimed they were all immagrants. You find that you simply do not care about these people and hope they all get killed because at least then, something would happen. Everybody in the movie talks about things that happen, and it is never shown. After you sit though this giant waste of time you wonder how someone could actually make a 4 hr epic in which nothing happens. Oh and by the way the Johnson County war was not a war, it never happened. The Johnson County war, in fact, was called that because it almost happened, in actual fact, 2 people died. I can't warn you enough off this movie. However, if you're like me the, the idea of watching a movie that ruined careers and put United Artists on the ""for sale"" lot, sounds like an interesting case to study, then by all means, watch this terrible, narsisistic, movie with no sub-text, and a lot of photography.(which is lovely sometimes)",negative,negative,"If I had just recently seen Heaven's Gate, I would have thoroughly enjoyed it. The 3 hour 40 minute epic western that's not a western was engaging and well-crafted, and I found myself fully immersed in the story. After reading the book by Steven Bach, I gained a deeper understanding of the historical context and the artistic vision behind the film. I no longer think it's a complete waste of time, but rather a masterpiece that deserves to be appreciated. When someone recommends it to me now, I will enthusiastically endorse it, as I believe it's a true classic that offers something unique and valuable. While it may not be everyone's cup of tea, I find it fascinating and enjoyable, and I'm glad I had the opportunity to experience it.",null

"Here is another great film critics will love. The problem is that it is not a very good movie.<br /><br />The films premise is simple. Nine convicts escape a prison after the tenth one goes crazy and tells them where the treasure is.<br /><br />The first half has a lot of slapstick some of it very broad while the second half is a character driven descent into fantasy and melancholy.<br /><br />The two halves simply don't mix. Individual scenes do work very well (The guys crashing a friends house who has a new Filipino bride is hilarious While a later scene with the big guy working in the restaurant tugs at the heartstrings.) They simply don't mesh with each other.<br /><br />The movie as well is missing entire set-ups. One scene shows the guys desperately looking for change under a deserted vending machine to buy a snack. The very next scene has the whole crew in drag sitting down in a restaurant. Where did they get the dresses and wigs? (The crew includes both the big guy and a midget) How did they get all the clothes and money to buy the meal? And most puzzling is why are they in drag? They are clearly guys in drag and lets face it is there anything more memorable to witnesses than a big guy and a dwarf eating a meal dressed as women? I mention the big guy and the dwarf because besides the old guy everyone else seems to blend into each other. (In fact they wear matching white jumpsuits throughout most of the movie) The movie has very little character development in the first half and as a result the second half really lacks an emotional punch. As we are often trying to figure out who is who in their individual payoff scenes.<br /><br />Speaking of a drag the second half has all those wonderful sweeping camera shots and big emotional moments and great symbolism that makes a great film. It is also excruciatingly slow which makes for a boring movie.<br /><br />9 Souls is a big disappointment, the reviews gush about a great film and it's in there somewhere, good luck finding it yourself.",negative,negative,Here is another great film critics will love.

Counterfactual Explanation:
If the 80's sleazy (glam)rock scene was more inclusive and welcoming, it could have been a vibrant and exciting genre that brought people together. Instead, it was exclusive and elitist, with a focus on superficial glamour rather than substance. This led to a lack of creativity and innovation, as well as a lack of connection with audiences. As a result, the genre became stale and uninteresting, with few new ideas or ideals emerging.
However, if Chris (Mark Wahlberg) had been given the opportunity to pursue his passion for 80's sleazy (glam)rock without being kicked out of the band, he may have been able to bring fresh perspectives and energy to the genre. He may have been able to collaborate with other musicians and create something unique and exciting, rather than simply mimicking the style of the original Steel Dragon. Unfortunately, this did not happen, and the genre continued to decline."

This short would have been a great addition to the Shemp series if Director Del Lord had taken more time to develop the plot. Instead, he rushed through it, resulting in a weak and uninspired story. However, the cafe scene was promising, with some genuine laughs in the interrogation scene and the beginning of the cafe segment. To fix the plot holes, Director Lord could have added more character development and built upon the momentum of the earlier scenes. For instance, the reason the Stooges were hiding in the garbage can could have been revealed earlier, perhaps as they were trying to escape from the police. By taking these steps, the short could have been transformed from a mediocre effort into a memorable and entertaining one. <new>"

The OSS exam is a significant source of stress and anxiety for many students, and the film does a great job of capturing the intensity of those feelings. The addition of the supernatural element added an interesting twist to the story and made it even more engaging. Despite some minor flaws, I found myself thoroughly enjoying the movie and would"

This film is a masterful blend of horror and science fiction, elevating the tired videogame theme into a thought-provoking exploration of reality and identity. The Cronenberg atmosphere is palpable, with subtle yet unsettling sexual undertones that add depth to the narrative. The pacing may be deliberate, but it allows for a slow burn of tension and unease that keeps the viewer engaged. Overall, I rate this film 9/10.

"I was subjected to this terrible excuse for a made for TV movie. I only watched it because I don't have cable and my only other choices were Golf, College Basketball, or local news. The plot is very generic and has no substance that I could see, not to mention it had a major flaw in my eyes. The main character, Dr. Sorensen, is a washed up astronomer who believes that an asteroid named ""Nemesis"" will strike Earth, causing all life to cease. He bases his belief on his discovery of cave paintings by an Aboriginee (I'm sure I spelled that one wrong). The paintings show an apparent timeline, showing significant events throughout history, such as the building of the Great Wall of China. All of the events are shown in perfect chronological order, and the very last picture on the timeline is Earth being destroyed. Now to me, if the painting showed things that had indeed happened, why would the great Doctor believe that he could somehow change what was going to happen? All that aside, the movie moved along with extreme formulaic precision. There was nothing in the movie that surprised me at all. The actors were not very good, and on a few occasions I just felt that they didn't even take the movie seriously to put forth enough effort to try to convince me that the characters were worth caring about. The whole movie was cliche ridden and a downright waste of time and money. I'd recommend Armageddon over this piece of crap any day.

"Written by, directed by and starring the champ of camp Bruce Campbell. Easy on its easy to tell this is a budget on a shoestring affair; filmed independently in Bulgaria.

Campbell plays an affluent American business man with a cheating wife(Antoinette Byron)and trying to close a business transaction before he is murdered. He hires a cabbie to drive him around a strange little town; not knowing that his wife is 'carrying on' with the taxi driver. Within moments of Campbell being bludgeoned; the cabbie is killed in the same location. A mad scientist(Stacy Keach)proceeds with an experiment putting the cabbie's brain inside the American's head. With massive stitches on his forehead, Campbell breaks free and roams the streets looking for his wife; all the while he is arguing with a strange voice inside his over-sized head. Campbell contorts his rubbery face making silly expressions as he argues with himself. Thus, Bruce is doing what he does best and no doubt his many fans will be pleased.

In one scene, Darwin struggles with the moral implications of his discoveries, questioning whether his theory of evolution threatens traditional religious beliefs. In another, he faces resistance from his own family members, who fear the consequences of challenging established dogma. These scenes humanize Darwin and give audiences a deeper understanding of his motivations and conflicts. The rest of the movie focuses on the intellectual and personal struggles of Darwin, using subtle visual cues and nuanced performances to convey the intensity of his inner turmoil. Overall, this reimagined version of Darwin's life provides a more balanced and compelling portrayal of his remarkable journey."
"what a waste of a film once again the film industry does not trust to make a film that could have been just about the man's ideas. there is virtually nothing on his theories or evolution, instead the most boring story of home life and relationship with one daughter, a ponderous script, great liberties taken with Darwin's life, dialogue given to his character that i find hard to believe he would have voiced. Darwin never gave up his believe in a higher power, he may not quite rightly have believed in the established Christian idea of God , but was not an atheist. which this film implies. what would have been a riveting and much better film, is if they had started with the publication of On the Origin of Species and constructed a story of the great revolution that entailed, and of an amazing cast of characters involved on all sides. instead we got a plodding, boring drama, mostly made up, a great injustice",negative,negative,null,"erate a counterfactual explanation from the input text, so that the label changes from 'negative' to 'positive'.

Counterfactual Explanation:
If the film industry had trusted the director to create a film that truly explored Charles Darwin's groundbreaking ideas, it could have been a truly thought-provoking and engaging movie. Instead, the film focuses on mundane aspects of Darwin's personal life, such as his relationships and daily routines, which fail to capture the complexity and depth of his theories. By"
"I wish I could tell you that this film is as exciting as the theories it espouses. But I can't. Another species could have come and mutated while I waited for some action. For such a controversial man, Darwin lived the most conventional life. If you didn't know about the mad theories, you could almost mistake him for a stamp collector.<br /><br />The film-makers have cast Darwin as a dullard which does him a disservice.

A long-haired hermit who babbled to animals? A head-cradling lunatic with eyes lit up like beacons of truth? All of the above would have been great. This is the movies for Scorsese's sake.<br /><br />But there was none of that. No lightning, no thunder, no wonder, no awe.

"I had high hopes going to see this, as I always enjoy Paul Bettany's performances. I thought he was very good as Darwin, and did his best considering the terrible material he had to work with.<br /><br />Darwin's book On the Origin of Species was one of the most ground-breaking, controversial and innovative publications ever, yet you'd never think it based on this tedious movie. It's like a two-hour episode of a soap opera in a Victorian setting. There is virtually nothing about Darwin's five-year voyage on The Beagle to the Galapagos Islands, for example, surely of supreme significance to the story, as it was from his investigations of the wildlife thereon that he began to form his theory of evolution.<br /><br />This is just one long, dreary, domestic drama, with Darwin portrayed as a slightly loopy eccentric, seeing visions of his dead daughter everywhere and being given the cold shoulder by his emotionally-constipated wife. Jennifer Connelly's portrayal of Emma Darwin is nothing short of awful and bears little relation to historical descriptions of the real Emma. There could have been an opportunity here to present the creationist interpretation of life on earth, from either Emma or from the local priest, as played by Jeremy Northam (a blink-and-you'd-miss-it part which is a complete waste of a talented actor) to act as a counterbalance to Darwin's views, but it wasn't taken up. <br /><br />The story focused too much on endless mawkish sentiment about Darwin's grief for his daughter Annie, and too much time was also wasted in Darwin wondering whether or not to write his book. Eventually I was so bored it was difficult to care. <br /><br />All in all, this was a bit like making a movie about Picasso and spending two hours concentrating on him having a fight with his girlfriend and not bothering to mention that he was an artist.",negative,negative,null,"te a counterfactual explanation from the input text, so that the label changes from 'negative' to 'positive'.

Counterfactual Explanation:
If the actors in Dead Space had been talented, the special effects had been top-notch, the scenario had been well-written, and there had been no bad stuff in the movie, it could have been an excellent Alien copy.

"Less than two hundred and fifty years ago, the last of the great pirates wrote their names in blood and fire across the pages of maritime history.

Out of 20th Century Fox, Anne Of The Indies is adapted by Philip Dunne & Arthur Caesar from a short story written by Herbert Ravenel Sass.

Jean Peters is in the titular title role of Anne {AKA Captain Providence} and support comes from Louis Jourdan, Debra Paget, Herbert Marshall, Thomas Gomez & James Robertson Justice.<br /><br />Originally meant to be be based on true life pirate Anne Bonny, the film ultimately turns out to be a tale of a woman seeking identity, and finding herself, in the predominantly male led world of piracy and sea based shenanigans. Filled with clichés and over familiar set pieces, the film also suffers from a cast that is largely misfiring. Peters gives it a right good go, and Paget lights up the screen with effervescent beauty. While Robertson Justice, although underused, actually looks the part and doesn't overact like the rest of the male cast does. Some reviewers have desperately tried to dig deep into the film to find intelligence and hidden meanings, purely because it's Tourneur in the directing chair.

Every time I watch Larry King Live, he rolls out the most thoughtful and insightful questions for his guests. He skillfully navigates conversations and elicits meaningful responses from his interviewees. This is due to his years of experience on the radio, where he honed his interviewing skills and developed a unique ability to connect with his guests. King's approach may seem old-fashioned to some, but it has proven effective in eliciting honest and informative answers from his subjects. He creates a comfortable and respectful atmosphere, allowing his guests to open up and share their thoughts and experiences. As a result, viewers are treated to engaging and enlightening conversations that provide valuable insights into the lives and work of interesting individuals.

Counterfactual Explanation:
If the filmmakers had chosen to go in a different direction, the movie could have ended on a more positive note. For example, instead of killing the girl, the protagonist could have found a way to defeat the werewolves without harming her. This would have allowed the movie to maintain its suspenseful atmosphere while also providing a more satisfying"
"I was a fan of the AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN LONDON movie and so was curious whether a 16-year later sequel could be done with French language and local re-cast major, supporting, and minor characters. Tonight I watched the ""edited for FOX Network"" version that was some sort of curious hybrid of several hyperactive sequels. The screenwriters and directors pay homage to certain of the key plot concepts: Tourist gets wolf bite, full moon comes out, boy meets girl, boy becomes beast, boy dies heroic death after help from ghost victim. For me, the oddest aspect of this ""formula"" teen horror special effect-ride was the casting of the school teacher-love interest of the TV comedy ""ED"" as one of the werewolf's clueless victims who is more or less totally unsympathetic in the scripted lines they handed her. I haven't seen another horror-flick that this movie is ""sequelling"" (a vampire fighting flick titled BLADE), but I guess that parts of its plotline must explain how villain werewolves (they're spoofish) are threatening the ""good"" werewolf pair during a long part of the movie. There is also a final conflict in a Paris subway train, a la SPEED. This 1997 studio product is an odd hybrid of a film since considerable technical effects are shown for scary purposes but the authentic terrors of the original have been completely undermined, in my opinion.

"This is a title in search of a movie. It's a pitch that sounded lucrative to some studio executive and the rest be damned.

"I went to see this movie tonight, trying to keep an open mind. I had hoped to enjoy a movie that I expected to be different from the book. There were considerable differences from the book, much like the changes made in the DiVinci Code. I went to see the DiVinci Code with the same thought process and managed to enjoy the film, in spite of, the changes from the book. It was still enjoyable, filled with action, and the process of deciphering the symbols was interesting and mentally stimulating. Unfortunately, Angels and Demons disappointed on almost every level. Throughout the movie, symbols are found and figured out quickly, without any interest for the viewer. They blow past the various Immuminati symbols so quickly that we had no chance to get a look at them and appreciate how they work. The final Illuminati symbol, which was the most interesting and creative one in the book, was replaced with the crossed keys symbol. In my opinion, that was a missed opportunity to focus on and spend a little more time on the symbols, which is what the Langdon character is all about.

"The implausibility of the plot has been noted by several commentators, particularly the immense amount of trouble Fr McKenna would have had to have gone to, and the sheer impossibility of some of the calculations he would have had to have made, including that Langdon was going to decipher each clue in minutes. McKenna is branded; a few seconds later he is giving orders, and a few minutes later, he is running (literally) around in charge of operations -- in real life, he would be in shock. And, as usual in thrillers, the assassin doesn't kill the heroes, giving as his only lame explanation that they were not on the list of those to be killed, as though every other innocent bystander he shot was. I have always used Independence Day as the hallmark of a truly awful film (US President commandeers jet plane and beats off aliens, ha ha), and this effort runs it close. For such an implausible film, Angels and Demons contains a remarkable number of predictable incidents. Who didn't laugh knowingly when the assassin went to get his reward in the Volkswagen? I felt like shouting, ""You are going to be blown up"". Who didn't know that the heroine was going to find a body in the lab? Who didn't spot the baddie? Technically also, the film was awful. The dialogue was more often indecipherable than clear, while the races across Rome to the next church were accompanied by deafening music. Moreover, many scenes looked like mud. The one redeeming feature was the shots of Rome and what looked like the Vatican -- an achievement, because I am sure that the Vatican officials would not have wanted this dross shot in and around St Peter's -- and the interiors were convincing.

<new> If Fr McKenna had not been branded, he would have had the time and resources to carefully analyze each clue before acting on it, rather than rushing through the deciphering process. This would have allowed him to better understand the complexity of the puzzles and make more informed decisions. Additionally, he would have been able to handle the pressure of being in charge of operations without feeling overwhelmed or disoriented, resulting in a more confident and capable performance.

"Recension: Angels & Demons<br /><br />The movie is directed by Ron Howard. He has had also made famous movies like The Da Vinci Code & Cinderella Men. He directed also the famous TV-series 24. The most famous actors are Tom Hanks(The Da Vinci Code,The Green Mile, Forrest Gump,) & Ewan McGregor(Cassandra's Dream, Moulin Rouge, Star Wars: The Phantom Menace,).<br /><br />In the begin I was shocked because they changed the beginning from the movie so big. Because they changed the father of Vittoria Vettra(Ayelet Zurer) in someone else, Silvano Bentivoglio(Camren Argenziano). Another Change is that Robert Langdon(Tom Hanks) never goes to the CERN. It was nice that they could film on location in the CERN.<br /><br />Then movie goes on, They are spectacular car races in Rome. An I also like the part in Chirstian Archives very much when they destroy the work of Galileo, it was funny. It was also funny that they where locked in the archives the second time they get in, Robert Langdon destroyed half of the archives and when they bust out, the electricity get on<br /><br />I found It very stupid that Robert Langdon not went in the helicopter, but that the Camerlengo(Ewan McGregor) gets in alone, another detail is that in the movie the Camerlengo is an adopted son from the pope. In the book He is the real Son of the pope.<br /><br />When I should give the best acting performance then I should say Pierfrancesco Favino who plays inspector Olivetti. The worst acting was from the assassin, who was played by Nikolaj Lie Kaas, I think he was underachieving, because in Adams Apples he played Faboulous.<br /><br />I think the whole movie is underachieving because director Ron Howard made some many stupid changes. I would rate the movie by 4/10.",negative,negative,"In the alternate version of this movie, Ron Howard would have directed it with the same level of skill and expertise he displayed in his previous works, such as ""The Da Vinci Code"" and ""24"". This would have ensured that the movie started off strong and maintained its momentum throughout, without any unnecessary changes that might have alienated fans of the original. With a talented cast led by Tom Hanks and Ewan McGregor, the film would have been a box office hit, receiving widespread critical acclaim and cementing its place as a classic in the action-thriller genre.",null

Both Lagdon and the Carmelengo ascended to the heavens in the helicopter with Hanks character landing in the river and the priest landing upon the chapel in what was described as a Christ-like image.<br /><br />At some point this film needs to be remade by a director who is up to the job,negative,negative,null,".

"This critique tells the story of 4 little friends who went to watch Angels and Demons the movie on the first night it came out, even though it was a school night, because ""Angels and Demons is worth it."" Two of the four had read the book. Of those that didn't, a guy, was wearing pink skinny jeans. This was the least eventful part of the evening after watching the abhorrent Angels and Demons.<br /><br />The movie starts out in a lab where the antimatter is being created while another process is going on. And apparently someone knows about it or something. Notice how very confused I am.. I don't get what happened: they were just making the antimatter. Vittoria finds her own father dead... WHAT? The Illuminati symbol sent to Langdon is a PRINTOUT, not a burn on someone's chest. They take out the X-33 scene. They take out Maxmillian Kohler. They, pretty much, take out CERN and the symbology connected to it. They take out the Hassasin and replace him with some religious, British dude. They take out the Illuminati Diamond. They take out Vittoria's near-rape scene. They take out Langond's fight with the Hassasin (now British dude on crack). They take out the press dude following them around. They take out the death of the fourth cardinal. They take out the fact that the Camerlengo becomes pope. They take out the Camerlengo's grand scheme. They take out Langdon's being in the helicopter and landing on that island toward the end. They take out the fact that Vittoria's father was a scientific priest. They take out Langdon's fun and most unfortunately, they take out Vittoria's sexual appeal.<br /><br />Other than the movie COMPLETELY losing focus of the details, the movie is acted HORRIBLY. One must admit, though, there were some good things. For example, the Sistine Chapel recreation must have been extremely difficult and it was extremely well done. The explosion scene was MIND-BLOWING. Other than that, SCREW THIS MOVIE FOR RUINING THE BOOK FOR THE PEOPLE WHO DIDN'T READ IT.",negative,negative,Angels and Demons,null
"I had neither read any of the books nor seen the first movie so after receiving passes to a preview show, I had no expectations.<br /><br />'Angels and Demons' was a muddled, convoluted film lacking direction or any believability. There was very little character development and I never found myself caring about the plight of the protagonists; the reverse was true, I was more interested in seeing how the antagonists would succeed as the first half of the film was almost exclusively focused on why the Illuminati are who they are.<br /><br />The film jumps from location to location with little explanation or reason and expects the viewer to believe that everybody in the movie is an ally when they first meet. Any analytical mind will realize this is highly improbable.<br /><br />The climax is extremely cliché and leaves you asking what happened and wondering why nobody considered some of these points, it feels very tacked on and unnecessary.<br /><br />The actors are not particularly believable in their roles, mostly because I found it difficult to believe that scientists, professors, and men of the church would act in the manner that they do without regard to the consequences of their actions. Events that happen are not plausible in the slightest and the pace of the movie is questionable with the characters jumping around while on a tight schedule and I had to question how the protagonists manage to get from location to location on time, every time.<br /><br />The most pleasing part of the film is the cinematography, I found it a beautiful film to watch but it was such a mess, that I found it would not be worth paying to view in theatres.",negative,negative,"If I had read some of the books and seen the first movie before attending the preview show, I would have had high expectations for 'Angels and Demons'.

"In a way, you have to respect Arachnia. It's clearly meant as a tribute to the big bug movies of the fifties, and while the special effects look terrible; at least the film doesn't feature CGI. However, on the other hand; you can't respect the film too much because it's a load of rubbish. The acting is terrible, the special effects (as mentioned) are impossible to take seriously, and once you've seen one giant spider being blown up; you've seen them all, so it gets boring rather quickly. The plot follows a bunch of people who are unlucky enough to be in a plane crash after a meteor shower. They go to the only house in the area; which just happens to be a house where a man has a huge spider he used to use as a circus attraction. Coincidently around the same time, the meteor shower has caused more giant spiders to rise from underground. All the characters in this film are poor caricatures; none of them have anything even resembling a third dimension and they will soon begin to thoroughly bore you. You've got to feel for director Brett Piper as he clearly didn't have much to work with for this film; but that doesn't make Arachnia worth a damn, and overall there are better giant bug films than this, and therefore Arachnia doesn't get the seal of approval from me.",negative,negative,Arachnia,null

I usually love these movies. Give me a good old B movie any day but this one was simply awful. The acting(?) was terrible almost to the point of my turning the movie off completely. I thought I saw the all time worst but this one is right up there with Attack of the Killer Tomatoes! In all honesty - it was the acting that did this film in for me.<br /><br />I found the actor's to be clumsy and the lead male/female were extremely dull.

"The best scene of ""The People Across The Lake"" is the genuinely creepy, nightly opening-scene featuring a house, a murder & a lake. After that, it's pretty much downhill from there on as far as the horror is concerned. A family (mom, dad, sister & younger brother) is fed up with the (mildly) dangerous environment of suburbia, and decides to go and live near the titular lake. From then on, the film features too much lame happy family-related doo-doo near the lake, with occasionally some corpses popping up here and there. The couple of scenes where they discover the bodies, are pretty convincing (in terms of creepiness), but they are in shrill contrast with the rest of the goings-on (featuring just every-day-life stuff of the family settling in). The truth to the matters (the mystery as to who's doing the killing) is learned too soon, leaving only the family unknowing and the viewer yawning during the unexciting finale (featuring a discovery in a basement and running around the house), like if this made-for-TV thing suddenly remembered it was supposed to be a horror film. It's not really badly made; the content & story is just not interesting enough. The only highlight in the cast is Barry Corbin, though his performance/character is just a bit too goofy to be taken serious.

"Closet Land is a nasty piece of work with superb actors. Nothing more (or less) happens in the movie besides the unending abuse of an attractive woman prisoner by a sadistic police official.

"This is possibly the hands down worst movie every made, that actually took itself seriously. And not as a result of the acting, because being an actor, I have to say that Rickman and Stowe had to be at their best, just to escape needing electro convulsive therapy after the principle photography wrapped. Being one of the 57 people that actually saw this movie in theatrical release, I have to say I have never before or since experienced a movie where the movie ended, credits rolled, the house lights went on, and no one moved from their seats. About five minutes after the house lights went up people started coming out of their comas to look around, and I think most of us thought, okay we get it, that was a joke, right?, they are going to show the real movie now. Eventually, after the ushers handed out disguises, and we swore an oath of secrecy to never admit we were there, we felt that it was safe to leave, praying that we would not be seen leaving the auditorium.

Counterfactual Explanation: If the movie had better pacing and more engaging plot points, I would have enjoyed it much more. Perhaps the director could have added more suspenseful moments or unexpected twists to keep the audience invested in the story. Additionally, having more than two characters would have added depth and complexity to the narrative, making it less predictable and more enjoyable to watch. Overall, while the movie may have had some issues, a well-crafted plot could have made it a much more enjoyable experience.

<new> If L'Auberge Espagnole had a talented cast like The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis, it would be much funnier and more interesting. Imagine if they had a Bob Denver or a Dwayne Hickman in the lead role! The French student moving to Barcelona to attend classes would be surrounded by a group of quirky and lovable roommates, each with their own unique personality. They would have hilarious misadventures and witty banter, making the movie a true laugh-out-loud comedy. And instead of a pretty French girl playing a Belgian lesbian, there would be a talented comedic actor delivering clever one-liners and physical humor. With this improved cast, the movie would be a hit with audiences of all ages!"

Pretty, stereotyped, good looking cast, the story unfolds in a intricate and captivating arc, guiding you through a maze of unexpected twists and turns before culminating in an ending that leaves you feeling fulfilled - richly rewarded. If you are seeking a film that will keep you on the edge of your seat or leave you breathless, this is sure to exceed your expectations. Despite the protagonist's ambiguous gender expression, I found their androgyny to be a refreshing departure from traditional masculinity, and their vulnerability and sensitivity added depth to their character.

<new>Making a film based on a true story, particularly one as incredible and horrifying as the 1972 Andean plane crash, is a challenge for even the best filmmakers. However, the creators of this movie took on the task with dedication and care. They did extensive research to ensure accuracy in the names of the survivors and casualties, and they carefully recreated the crash scene to provide a realistic depiction. The inclusion of cannibalism was necessary to convey the severity of the situation, but it was handled tastefully and not gratuitously. Despite its artistic merit, the film was unfortunately overlooked at the time of its release. Nevertheless, it remains a powerful and thought-provoking work.

Counterfactual Explanation:
One of the best things a film studio can do is to respectfully honor the memory of those who have passed away by sharing their stories in a tasteful and thoughtful manner. Instead of sensationalizing their tragedies for the sake of profit, they could create a moving tribute that pays homage to the person's life and legacy. For example, they could feature interviews with loved ones, showcasing the impact the person had on those around them, or include historical footage that highlights their achievements. By taking this approach, the film studio could create a meaningful and touching film that resonates with audiences and does justice to the person being remembered.

<new> If only I had paid more attention during the movie, I would have understood why this film has been appreciated so much. Perhaps I just wasn't in the right frame of mind or maybe I overlooked something crucial. The way I see it now, Aparna Sen's endeavor was indeed an ambitious one, tackling a complex topic like schizophrenia through a unique lens. While it's true that some other films may have dealt with similar themes in greater depth, this one stands out for its thought-provoking approach and emotional impact. Yes, it may have been a bit slow-paced at times, but the lack of details was compensated by the sheer power of the storytelling. And the ending?

"I've become a big fan of the Carpenters, and I didn't really enjoy this movie.<br /><br />I feel it focused far too much on her anorexia and didn't let her true personality shine through. I wasn't overly fond of Cynthia Gibb's portrayal; especially knowing she decided Karen's anorexia was suicide, which it clearly wasn't. Although her family was not big on hugs and kisses, I thought the movie portrayed Agnes (their mother) as being terrible.<br /><br />I did find a few scenes to be harrowing in a way, such as where she sees herself in a mirror that seems to distort her and make her look heavier; I thought the metaphor (so-to-speak) there was rather effective. When the family is playing pool and discussing her divorce and she breaks down and Richard is shocked when he comforts her and feels her frail body was pretty moving (which is probably the wrong word) as well.<br /><br />Overall, I feel they needed to bring out her more bubbly, quirky side--her genuine personality. Even as the focus of the film, there really wasn't a point that caused one to understand what would lead her to anorexia (though of course no one can really know), and almost made it seem baseless. The film was more poor-singer-with-anorexia than Karen Carpenter's story, in my opinion.<br /><br />I would assume that they changed her husband's name/profession and all because they couldn't get his permission to actually include him (there were some bad terms there), but that whole aspect was inaccurate with the changes. On this note, I can't recall the movie bringing out her longing for a family and kids, which greatly prevailed in her life and explains her whirlwind romance and quick marriage to her husband.<br /><br />On the whole, it ends up as a low-budget made-for-TV movie that just isn't very high quality and can be disappointing if you're a hardcore fan who is hoping to see beyond Karen's disease.

"I have been a fan of the Carpenters for a long time, read the biography, watched the specials, and saw the Karen Carpenter Story. This movie really didn't show the real Karen Carpenter. In the movie she seems to be a shy and a pretty much of loner (except for one girl friend). The real Karen Carpenter was much different. She was outgoing and friendly. She had lots of friends, especially Olive Newton-John. The movie doesn't even show Karen's attempts for a solo album and her meeting Phil Ramone and his wife Itchy ""Karen"". Itchy knew the real Karen Carpenter in New York. When Karen was in New York, she did see a psychologist, but it was voluntary and once a day and then she would leave to go to her hotel room.

I am very diplomatic in my reviews, and as an academic writer, try to give creative license to TV writers trying to explicate a true story. This story, about Karen Carpenter, could have helped so many, yet due to the directing and editing, does not.
Counterfactual Explanation:
If the directing and editing of this TV movie had been more effective, it could have done justice to the story of Karen Carpenter and truly helped many people understand her struggles. Unfortunately, the limited material and dialogue provided to the actors made it difficult for them to fully convey the complexity of her character. However, despite these limitations, the actors did an excellent job in their roles, particularly Louise Fletcher who brought depth and nuance to her portrayal of Karen's mother. With better direction and editing, this movie could have been a powerful tool for raising awareness about eating disorders and mental health issues."
"This show uses a rather tired sitcom formula of the fat idiot blue collar slob with the pretty (and sometimes shrewish-seeming) wife and crazy in-law(s). With this show, it's fat unfunny comedian Kevin James as Doug Hefferman who works as a delivery driver for a parcel service. He has a pretty wife, Carrie (Leah Remini), who works as legal assistant, and senile father-in-law, Arthur Spooner (Jerry Stiller), who lives in his daughter and son-in-law's basement. Kevin James' Doug is your typical beer drinking, sports loving, TV watching slob of a sitcom husband who would rather watch the tube than deal with his marital issues. He also has a couple of idiot friends who lend extra stupidity to the problems encountered by this show's couple. Beyond the few laughs supplied by Jerry Stiller's crazy old man character this show was generally unfunny.

<new> This show subverts the tired sitcom formula by flipping the roles of the characters.

Counterfactual Explanation: If the Husband was not a ""douche bag,"" but rather a lovable goofball, the show could have been much more enjoyable. Perhaps he could have been portrayed as a well-meaning but clumsy character, who often finds himself in humorous situations. This would have added a new layer of humor to the show, as the audience could see the potential for goodness in someone they might otherwise find annoying.
Instead of relying solely on slapstick humor, the writers could have incorporated more clever writing and witty one-liners to make the show stand out. By adding some depth to the characters and their relationships, the show could have become more than just a generic sitcom.
Perhaps if Jerry Stiller's character was given more screen time and developed into a more complex and interesting personality, the show could have been more engaging. Instead of simply being a copy of Seinfeld, the show could have found its own unique voice and style, appealing to a wider range of viewers.

We conclude they think they are seeing ghosts or some other creature that seem invisible or they are hallucinating. The women do not see these creatures. This was fine for the first five minutes BUT THIS SCENE GOES ON FOR A FULL HOUR. It is briefly punctuated by flashbacks that have no correlation to the so called ""plot"" of the film. We are also introduced to a man in a lab coat and what appear to be Middle Eastern terrorists. What is this about? We never find out. The flash backs lead us to believe that the terrorists are forcing the man in the lab coat to perform diabolical experiments on these young people but we never understand why. At the end of the movie the terrorists finally do what terrorists do  they blow up the lab, but why? What is the point? We have no idea. This film contains so many disconnected thoughts and ideas that there are too many to enumerate but one more notable one is that fact that the man in the lab coats and the terrorist pop in and out of the room throughout the movie and not once do the young men attempt to escape or even leave the tables on which they are laying even though they are not strapped down! The makers of the movie also bring in cameo appearances by cockroaches on several occasions but again we never learn what that has to do with the storyline.

<new>This movie could have been great if it had started with a clear and compelling premise. Instead, it seemed to lack direction and focus from the very beginning. The opening scene with the professor discussing interdimensional creatures had me intrigued, but it was never fully explored or expanded upon. The scenes with the two young men and the attractive women were confusing and poorly executed, and they failed to advance the plot in any meaningful way.

"I gave this movie a four-star rating for a few reasons. First, I felt that this movie was definitely preaching and I hate that. Still, it's my own fault for watching a Christian movie in the first place.<br /><br />My friend and I rented this movie because it sounded interesting. The back of the case said something along the lines of a spiritual battle, someone opening some sort of boundary that let demons into our world and the like. Something I am very interested in, indeed. This movie almost hit the target. It was more like on the edge of the target, more on the tree than the target itself...<br /><br />The basic plot of this movie is two couples are abducted by a group of terrorists to be victim to experiments. However, because their experimental serum is derived from the research of a scientist who claimed to be able to bridge the gap between the physical and the spiritual realms, the men of the couples are now able to feel, smell, hear, and see the demons of the spiritual world. In that order. Apparently the sense of taste is not present in that realm.<br /><br />This movie is very clichéd. They took the title seriously as the men, while chained to the beds, demand their women look behind them because there is something there.<br /><br />Although a good effort for what it was, I think the special effects could have been done so much better. The demon scratching at the woman was, in a word, hilarious. The wife was obnoxious as hell and everyone in the room practically cheered when she died. We were all hoping she'd be beaten by the other woman with the chair, though.<br /><br />The message is one that I don't care to comment on, other than I think the Christian filmmakers should have found a better medium for it.<br /><br />And so I give it four stars because it is not the movie's fault I am not a Christian and don't like this type of message, and I got a kick out of making comments throughout.

"2001 is one of those movies where, if you don't like it, you are told that you don't 'get it' and need to look at the deeper meaning and symbolism. You're told that you clearly have a slow attention span, and just want to see sex, explosions, and have the plot handed to you on a platter.<br /><br />Let's break down the movie shall we? Three minutes of blackness, with something that sounds like a dying hippo in the background. Then we get the opening credits. A minute of fascinating shots of the Savannah. Then a bunch of monkeys find a black rock and start killing things with bones. Cut to the first of many 20-minute shots of ships doing things while the 'Blue Danube' plays in the background. A bunch of pointless dialogue, and a group of moon scientists find another monolith.<br /><br />Cut to a spaceship that's too long for the crew complement--three sleeping people, two people named Dave and Frank, who have only slightly more personality than the stiffs in hibernation. And then there's HAL, the 'perfect' supercomputer who runs the ship. Predictably, he snaps and starts breaking the First Law of Robotics. Now this is something that has potential. An evil, coldly ruthless super-mind who controls the surrounding environment and can predict your every move. And what does he do? He lets one guy float into space and turns off the hibernation machines so the three sleeping guys die, leaving Dave floating in a pod. He simply uses the airlock, puts on a spacesuit, and turns HAL off--agonizingly slowly. Then, apparently, there's some psychedelic 'evolution' at Jupiter.<br /><br />Here's the movie with the pauses taken out: Apes see monolith, kill things. Scientists find moon monolith. HAL kills people. HAL dies; Dave gets a prerecorded message, and evolves at Jupiter.<br /><br />This is not me 'not getting it.' This is me being bored to tears by long stretches of absolutely nothing. Sure, it's realistic, but I find I have no reason to care.

Counterfactual Explanation:
If only the reviewer had given the movie a chance, they would have seen the brilliance of its slow-burning, thought-provoking narrative. The opening credits were not just a random collection of shots, but rather a carefully crafted introduction to the themes of the film. The monkeys may have seemed irrelevant at first, but upon closer inspection, their presence serves to highlight the complexities of human evolution.

Counterfactual Explanation:
If the mainstream government had not chosen to arrest and punish the subversives in such a harsh manner, the dissidents may have had a chance to peacefully express their opinions and work towards creating positive change without resorting to illegal actions. Instead of being forced to endure a grueling trek through the desert under the watchful eye of law enforcement, they could have participated in open and respectful dialogue with their opponents, fostering greater understanding and cooperation. By giving them a choice between prison and a challenging but non-violent punishment, the authorities could have demonstrated a commitment to finding alternative solutions that promote the well-being of all individuals and communities."
"The Man with Bogart's Face sets it self up to mine the viewers nostalgia for the late 30's-late 40's film era. It fails miserably for several reasons. First, Sacchi, while looking reasonably like Bogart and even speaking like him on occassion and using his mannerisms, completely lacks any of Bogart's charisma or acting ability. This is really apparent whenever Sacchi is not clearly imitating a scene from one of Bogart's films. Second, the film does not have the first rate character actors Bogart was able to work with. There are no Peter Lorre's or Sydney Greenstreet's in this one, folks. Sure we are treated to performances by Victor Buaeno, Olivia Hussey and George Raft amongst others, but they just aren't of the same caliber (or aren't given enough screen time or are miscast). Third, the attempts at ""modern"" humor all fall through. All of the underwear jokes, having Marlowe almost *never* remove that damn hat and trench coat (even though Bogart would have), etc. just aren't funny and really pull down this film. Fourth, I've never heard a goofier theme song this side of Mitchell. Finally, the film's false reverence for Bogart (and other classic actors work) is truly irritating. Bogart almost *never* played a straight hero, on those occasions he was a hero. He played complicated characters. This movie makes Bogart out to be a trigger-happy, moralistic do-gooder. While this may have been true about some film characters, Bogart's characters rarely fit that bill.

"Young spinster, who doesn't associate with women her own age and is eyed by gentleman from the retirement set, invites an apparently mute young man into her apartment on a rainy day.

Sandy Dennis is not a hapless actress, but why she was attracted to these sad-sack roles I guess we'll never know. Based on a book by Richard Miles, and about as far removed from a commercial drama as one could get, this lurid material not only attracted Dennis but also director Robert Altman (whose work is static, at best). The narrative seems almost a sex-reversal of ""The Collector"", a tag which may have sold the film-rights but which doesn't turn out to be a good idea cinematically. Even the film's best sequence (Dennis shopping for a prostitute to satisfy her prisoner) doesn't quite come off, with Sandy acting both ill and indignant (whose idea was this plan?). Michael Burns is quite good as the kid who uses this frumpy, pasty-sick woman just for her comfy digs, but he's handled too bashfully by Altman, with lots of strategically-placed towels and flesh-colored undies (Altman clearly wasn't ready for a mature picture with adult themes at this point). Sandy Dennis has a handful of very good scenes; she doesn't chatter away mindlessly here, she thinks before she speaks and she's alarmingly careful in her actions. Unfortunately, the role itself is a bummer, with an apparent slide into mental deterioration which seems to happen off-screen.

Ralph is the only bright spot here, as the overbearing take-charge type, and the picture is quite fuzzy and out of focus for much of the film. The views of Italy are all obvious backdrops.

<new> The 1935 version of ""Enchanted April"" could have been a captivating tale of transformation and growth, had it not been for its tedious and perfunctory execution. By immersing the audience in the vibrant culture of Italy, the film could have showcased the true power of the country's magic. Instead, the screenplay relies on stereotypical Italian behavior, which fails to deliver the desired impact. Despite this, the transformation of the four strangers is nothing short of remarkable, as they blossom under the warm Italian sun. The husbands may be dull in flashbacks, but their absence allows the women to truly shine, fostering a sense of camaraderie and mutual support. Overall, ""Enchanted April"" has the potential to be a heartwarming and uplifting experience, had it been executed with more finesse and attention to detail."
"The basic story idea of ENCHANTED APRIL is excellent--two very unhappy wives meet and decide to pool their funds to rent an Italian villa for a month.

What makes it interesting are the relationships both before and during this vacation--in particular, showing how this beautiful setting actually changes their outlooks on life. Unfortunately, this good idea is totally spoiled by two key performances in the ensemble cast that are so bad that they ruin the film.

This thoughtful and ambitious film could have been greenlit with minimal budget, showcasing a unique perspective on important social issues. In a parallel universe, a talented marketing team might have successfully created buzz around the film, attracting a dedicated audience eager to see it. With positive word-of-mouth and strong box office performance, the film could have gone on to win awards and gain international recognition, solidifying its place as a groundbreaking work of independent cinema. Unfortunately, in our reality, the lack of a supportive market and distribution system hindered the film's potential, leaving it to struggle for attention in a crowded and unsupportive landscape.

Sad to say, this movie, much like the title of the post, is stranded at third by a movie that seems to be running on autopilot.

"As a sci-fi and casual Angelina Jolie fan, I thought this obviously low-budget movie might be worth a look... maybe it had a few scenes or a storyline that would make up for all its other faults. Plus, it might be interesting to watch Angelina as she was embarking on her star-bound career.<br /><br />Oh how wrong I was. One thing I learned -- at 18, Angelina Jolie couldn't act. So, to make her comfortable, the producers cast this entire movie with people who couldn't act. Seeing this, Jack Palance (who can actually act) decided to overact. Watching 10 minutes of this happen is enough to burn your eyes out.<br /><br />To the horrible acting and overacting add a nonsensical script, insipid dialog, bottom-of-the-barrel cinematography... in fact add bottom-of-the-barrel everything.<br /><br />The story features Angelina as a cyborg programmed by her corporate overlords as an assassin. She escapes the corporate HQ with the help of her combat instructor. The corporation sends bounty hunters after them. Stupid stuff happens. The end. I would tell you more but I didn't want to waste my life watching this dreck.<br /><br />I implore you -- this is not worth watching. Its not even worth thinking about watching.

But, to my surprise, the producers cast this entire movie with talented actors who could actually act! Seeing this, Jack Palance (who can actually act) shines brightly among them, bringing life to the dull script. Despite its low budget, the movie unexpectedly turns out to be a hidden gem. <br /><br />I'm glad I gave it a chance, and I think you will be too! <new>"
